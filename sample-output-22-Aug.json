      "description": "Chiang Mai has had a deep Buddhist influence running over the last 1,000 years and this can be felt in the helpfulness, patience and generosity of the Thai and long-term transplants you come across. The city has an active community scene (nomads, spiritual seekers, hikers, creatives), several mountains with hiking spots and waterfalls surrounding the city, over 20 water bodies inside the city -- many have cafes and walks around, several public parks, and over 13 national parks with campgrounds within a 2hr drive. New cafes / art spaces are opening up every other week. Also, many temples that disseminate Buddhist teachings and run mindfulness retreats near and around the city. The nervous system of Chiang Mai is a relaxing one - the city often feels as an open space without walls. Burning season ( Feb - Apr) sees an AQI of 200+ and either requires you to stay indoors or travel elsewhere. May/June are on the hotter side, and July - Sep sees an average rainfall of an hour a day. Oct to Jan is a cool season with Dec to early Feb being the blooming season. While each season brings a different flavor with it, Chiang Mai is a paradise throughout excepting the burning season period. Other notes: English proficiency of the local population is basic. Old city is walking friendly and has many quiet spots, Nimman is the westerner friendly spot and also sees high traffic, Pong Noi is more artsy / hippie.",

      "description": "Bangkok is one of my favorite cities. Very cyberpunk vibes. Huge, full of skyscrapers, impressive concrete infrastructure for the BTS skytrain, great architecture and design, super fancy shopping malls, lights, noise, tuktuks, street food vendors, prostitutes and ladyboys, cannabis shops, and advertisements everywhere for beauty products, cosmetic surgery clinics or various furutistic-sounding medical treatments. There are two ways to live in Bangkok: either you live cheaply in a poorly insulated room and eat mostly street food, in which case it will be hard to like the city due to how hot, noisy and chaotic it is at street level. Or you have a bit more budget and live in a luxury 40th-floor apartment with AC, gym, pool, sauna, and when you go out you take the AC'd BTS or taxi to an AC'd building in which you can shop, get a massage, go to the restaurant or have cocktails on the rooftop. This is the way. You do have to like living in big cities, but I think what makes Bangkok most attractive is the easy access to luxury at a relatively affordable price, and how nice the Thai people are.",

Most are looking for an easy, fun and peaceful life -- which is great, but if you are building something or running a business it can feel like the culture doesn't support you in the ways you may want or need.

      "description": "I try to like this city and been many times (twice for 1 month and few times for few days) but it's been pretty rough. Overall malaysia is not that easy for slow nomads (if you want to stay for 1-3 months) and I still preferred penang much more. This might be good place for family to settle or if you having base for most of the year with many friends around. LOGISTICS You will waste a lot of time to move around: - if you hate malls you won't be able to avoid it - crossing some street sometimes require to dive deep into those dungeons and navigating inside maze. Getting you eye attacked by everything blinking around, signboards and ads. I also don't enjoy eating out inside malls - it's just too crowded and loud feel rushed without much vibe. - grab is cheap (most of the time except peak hours) but unreliable. Sometimes you will wait 20min for it or driver will cancel last minute and you wait more time. There are also restricted zones and hard to figure out pickup spot or you still have to walk to pickup spot either in the heat or rain. Traffic jam is also big minus. - city is pretty unwalkable. you will need to know some secret shortcuts or walk around malls or hop from mall to mall because there is too many highways. Something like crossing from Pudu to Bukit Bintang that should be just a 20min walk is not a good adventure. Bangkok is much more walkable in this way - GPS is not very accurate because of high buildings. And google maps so often totally wrong both for walking and driving. It will navigate you to walk on highway or navigate grab driver with completely ridiculous path if driver don't know the area. - there is no grab bike like in vietnam or thailand or indonesia so you will waste more time and money on being stuck in the traffic or being late to meet your friends for dinner/lunch - I didn't use much public transport since you need touch & go card and top it up to use most public transport and I didn't feel like going to KL sentral and navigating that maze just for the sake of it. Wish you could use pay with debit card to easily buy ticket from most stations. - not easy to rent motorbike for 1 month and I feel like safer to drive in vietnam since in malaysia there are more cars, they are more aggressive and roads are not flat so hard to navigate which lane you have to use or ramp to take. It's also raining almost every day around 4pm, and harder to find parking spots. COWORKINGS There are many good very modern coworkings for very good price but: - it's freaking cold in most of them I tried - you have take jacket and long pants - there is no community or events. Haven't met any nomads, some coworks were just almost empty. There is no any basic stuff like members lunch or occasional event to have dinner or beer to get to known other members. Most of the time those are locals or expats that have their own circle and not interact much. - most of them in some malls or high office buildings on high floor - you will waste a lot of time waiting for a lift. Many located in places where there is not many local food outside just some food inside malls. I find it hard to relax inside malls. - some of them have horrible onboarding like you have to fill few pages with your bank number and swift code just to pay deposit even if you are just for 1 month and fill same ridiculus paper when checked out to get your deposit 2 months later - feel like filling tax return. - the city is to big and too many coworking spaces made everyone spread out - hard to have nomads located in some specific spot like nimman in CM or My An in Danang or Sukumvit in BKK. ACCOMODATION - not much option for short term rental except airbnb or coliving (but they usually not well located and have to commit for minimum 3 months). Monthly rental will be around $1000 or more for something that you can have 3-4 times cheaper in Chiang Mai or Danang. ACTIVITIES - didn't found many events targeting nomads so it can feel lonely. Also unless you are in Bukit Bintang its hard to spontaneously go for a beer or dinner with someone. Alcohol also more expensive in bars. - there are some nice parks and hiking paths but logistics makes it complicated to benefit from those more often rather than once every (few) week(s). ON POSSITIVE SIDE + food is still great because of malay, chinese, indian options and can find even good cheap street food or use grab food easily + many apartments are very modern, lifts mostly fast and have things like gym, pool and parking as a standard. + everyone speak english so nice to be able to talk with grab driver and have small conversation + bahasa malay is easier to learn and using latin alphabet in case you want to settle here for longer and easier to make local friends + 3 months visa exemption is very generous (but not many options for staying longer without involving lots of paperwork) + great travel hub for reaching to other countries in SE Asia + many networking events if you prefer more professional networking for a startup TLDR; Place has a lot of potential and if you love big city vibe and luxury condos and malls you might love it. If you prefer more Chiang Mai, Bali, Danang, Penang vibe you probably will be disappointed.",

The Recoleta neighborhood is super convenient and very safe. I never had any issues walking around day or night even with my phone out. Talking to locals, they love foreigners and are just very friendly people overall. Even though I'm considered Black in the USA they referred to me as \"brunette\" which I found endearing. Although I will say, you do need to have a basic level of Spanish. If you're A1-A2 Spanish you'll be fine. The dollar is very strong against the Guarani as well so dining out is very cheap. There's also a lot of new buildings so it's easy to find clean/well maintained AirBnBs. I think the biggest negative is that power outages can happen somewhat frequently and entire neighborhoods can be without power for a few hours at a time.",

Yes, it’s very expensive — but there is no city on earth that’s more captivating in my opinion. I used to think that New Yorkers were smug by claiming that NYC was better than everywhere else, but now I totally get it lol. My personal favourite neighbourhood is the Upper East Side, which is where you’ll find the coveted Museum Mile. But I also like Harlem and Brooklyn. Truthfully, the best thing you can do is just wander around with stops in local eateries along the way. As another reviewer mentioned, there’s a lot of main character energy in NYC. Personally, I love that — and I always feel energised when I’m here. It makes me want to go out and achieve my biggest dreams, and the New York skyline is captivating. In terms of safety, I actually found NYC safer when visiting than I have prior to COVID. I may have just been lucky, and I was only there for a week, but that’s my opinion/experience. YMMV, of course. Some subway stations made me feel on edge, but my experience was fine for the most part. (I still think the subway needs a huge revamp, though, as it’s definitely looking quite tired 😄). I would love to come back here and live for 3-12 months. Anything more than that would probably be too much for me personally, but at least visiting is something that you must do at least once. And even if you come here 20+ times, there’ll always be something interesting that you haven’t seen/experienced before.",

I would also add that antisocial behaviour is quite common here and teenagers are heavily involved in crimes as police don't do anything with them because of their age. Basically there were months that my area was patrolled by gangs on bikes trying to snatch the phone (luckily they are less noticeable in the last period). The video of cutting the bike chain in front of the shopping centre in day light got viral and even the criminal was without a mask.

It's very safe, no pick pocketers, no scammers, no addicts, streets are safe at night, and women are not afraid in general to walk at night, very unlikely to attract even catfishing. Not sure why it rates lower than cities with culture of thinking a single woman is a willing woman. 2. The country itself is not friendly to LGBTQ+ citizens: no gay marriage, pushbacks towards gender correction, and long aggression history from family members. Having said that, it's not bad for visitors: two guys or gals holding hands or kissing may attract attention and possibly some insults if you are unlucky, but that's about it. You will not be denied service anywhere on these grounds. 3. Racism is relatively rare, at least for Poland, with an exception to middle eastern people, which may meet with some enmity. If you keep to tourist/more upscale areas and white collar communities, you'll be fine. 4. Lots to do, most young people speak at least basic English (though few among people remembering communist times). People may sometimes seem abrasive due to a culture of directness and honesty over manners, but they are generally willing to help and are much more open than in western or northern Europe. 5. Cost of living is considerably lower than in other European cities. Accommodation is expensive, like everywhere, but expect to pay 50-66% of what you'd pay in Western Europe. Tourism is not an important industry (relatively), so there are no backpacking hostels with mingling culture that I know of. Overall, however, it is not Asia, so you'd better have a western-level job. 6. Winter can be cold, and autumn is typically overcast and rainy. 7. A mix of nice Old Town, modern downtown and nice modern compounds with old, ugly soviet architecture. Sadly, everything seems to lack a guiding thought and is often laughably incoherent. 8. Lots of parks, big and small! A lot of streets are lined with trees, so, time of year permitting, you are never far away from some green. The city is clean, and areas built after the fall of communism are well-kept, but in the poor districts you may see (ugly) graffiti or an occasional drunkard (especially at night). 9. Free libraries. Although you might not be able to get a member card and borrow books, the larger ones will generally let you work in silence for free, although electric sockets or wifi may be missing. 5G is however cheap and generally reliable enough to stream even movies. Overall, I'd probably recommend Wrocław/Gdańsk more due to proximity to the mountains/sea and better preserved architecture, but Warsaw is definitely more cosmopolitan and busy.",

      "description": "Lived in Copenhagen for just under three years, and for the whole time, I have worked remotely as a freelancer. It's pretty much as perfect as you're going to get in terms of urban design; getting around is easy and safe by bike, and the public transport network is efficient and reasonably-priced. Lots of fun things to do for a relatively small city, and the locals are—from personal experience—incredibly friendly. Pros: - Very safe. You can walk around most areas round-the-clock and not have to worry, violent crime is largely gang-related but even then still quite rare - Lots of fun things to do, many of which don't require a huge budget. For example, you can swim in the harbor baths year-round and simply sit outside with a book when the weather is good. Nightlife is pretty decent for pubs, bars, and restaurants; I'm not a huge fan of clubs in general, so I can't comment too much on that. - The council actively tries to improve locals' quality of life, which is a huge contrast to where I am from (London) - Friendly locals and a big international community. It can be hard to make friends, but I would say that you'll be okay if you join clubs/actively pursue your own interests. Instagram and MeetUp are both great options for finding people with similar hobbies :) - A good mix of architecture. You've got pretty old houses and more interesting modern designs, some are hideous (i.e. Kaktus Towers) but most blend in quite well IMO - The airport is very good, close to the city center, and has lots of flights across Europe and other continents - Close to both mainland Europe and the rest of Scandinavia. You can get to Hamburg in 4.5 hours by train, for example, and Sweden is not far away - Summer in Copenhagen is amazing. Long daylight hours, reliable weather for the most part, feels like you're on a two-and-a-half month long holiday. - Lots of coworking spaces. I usually work from Spaces, Regus has various offices as well but these are hit and miss. The best ones are Havnegade and Fuglevangsvej in my opinion Cons: - Winters aren't great. It's windy, it rains a lot, and the daylight hours are short. However, that's a great excuse to visit the many cafés and restaurants, because hygge and stuff :) - The cost of living is much higher than most European cities. If you're moving here as a remote worker and staying long-term, I would personally say that you should ensure that your income is at least $5,500 per month. Taxes are also high - The housing market is a bit of a mess. Rent prices are high and it can be difficult to find an apartment if you're on a budget. Movinn and LifeX are two choices you can look at as starting points - Moving to Denmark if you're not an EU/EEA/Nordic/Swiss citizen is very difficult. I have an EU citizenship through one of my parents so this didn't affect me, but you'll have to deal with a lot of paperwork if you aren't one. If you're from EU/EEA/Nordics/Switzerland, it's pretty easy if you have the means to support yourself - The city center can be quite crowded on weekends, especially around Nyhavn etc.—but if you leave the touristy parts, you'll be fine. Copenhagen has plenty of other interesting neighborhoods anyway :) Overall, I would say that Copenhagen is easily one of the most liveable cities in Europe—if not top of the list. The cost of living is high and it can be difficult to move here, but once you've settled, life is pretty good in my opinion. You can get around with English, but learning Danish opens new opportunities and a lot of stuff is done in Danish rather than English. If you're able to move here, and you can stand the winter weather, I highly recommend it :)",

      "description": "I've never had such rude, aggressive, slow, uninterested service anywhere as in Portugal. Portuguese do not understand the basic idea of a customer paying for a service and getting something in return. Many Portuguese explicitly stated to me they really just don't care about money. But at the same time they complain about not making enough money because costs are so high. That sums up the Portuguese mindset: I'm not willing to work hard at my job to deliver a good product or service, but I expect to be able to live really well without working for it. The only companies/stores/restaurants where you get good service are run by Brazilians or other ex Portuguese colonies, or other foreigners. The Portuguese Uber drivers have terribly old unmaintained (and dirty!) cars and they will use you as a free therapist session to vent and complain about their lives in Portugal which always ends up being the fault of foreigners (the Indians, or the Brazilians!). They will not leave you any other choice than to just listen to their endless complaining for an hour. Which tires you down too. While paying for it! At least the Indian Uber drivers have clean modern cars and just do their job. My Uber rating went down radically here because Portuguese dislike foreigners and they will give all of them 3 or 4 out of 5. First time that happened anywhere in the world. My foreigner friends generally say they're tourists because Portuguese love tourists. But their tone switches fast when you tell them you live here, or especially when you buy a house. A big chunk of Portuguese, I'd say over half just really don't like any foreigners. One Uber driver after we complained came back to our destination to try punch us. This NEVER happened to me ANYWHERE in the world. I try and try and try and try and keep try to find the golden nuggets in this culture. There is something beautiful to the original Portuguese culture. The slow life, the grilled fish with rice. But Portuguese make it so damn hard to enjoy their culture. The smart and intelligent and successful Portuguese leave the country, which is why it has a massive brain drain and the lowest IQ level in Europe except Eastern Europe. The successful Portuguese parents put their kids in international schools so they can leave Portugal once they graduate because they know there's no opportunities there. It's a sick country, it needs help. I hope the influx of foreigner money will help this place long term. But the pushback from Portuguese for exactly that: foreign money, is immense. It's money that could go to them if they got their act together and offered products and services foreigners could spend it on. But instead the money goes elsewhere because Portuguese products and services are so incredibly low quality and rude. I will hope for the future of Portugal. But it won't be an easy ride.",

Many hotels, guest houses, airbnbs are fitted with an inverter to combat this (which basically means one or two sockets and lights in the place will still work during a power cut, so make sure your place has an inverter and your modem is plugged into one of the working sockets. No co-working spaces available in Pokhara at this time. Overall I'd definitely recommend it but the inverter is a must!

But that's very similar to Bangkok which is also an indoor lifestyle in my opinion. Generally airconditioning everywhere is great, except in the older pre-2010 buildings/malls. It's super modern, super international. You'll be in having lunch in a cafe and next to you is a table of Africans, the next table is Asians, the next table is white (often Russians). You don't actually see Europeans so much here. Also when I was in Dubai I started getting messages from all my European friends \"ohh Dubai is so horrible! so fake! so soulless\" which just astonished me. I get that there's problems like the labor exploitation, but it feels like the Dubai government is working actively to fix that. It feels a lot like Singapore where the government is trying to improve the lives of everyone in a methodical way which seems to work. If you like indoor aircon lifestyle, going to nice malls, cafes and restaurants and having great international food. As well as great gyms. And you have money to spend (you don't even need a lot but okay). You'll definitely like Dubai. If you are an outdoor person that values democracy, is more lefty in politics, don't have much money. You'll definitely not like Dubai.",

      "description": "Lived in Antigua for over a year and I absolutely loved it! It´s called the city of eternal spring because the weather is like a perfect spring day all year round. There are two seasons, rainy and non-rainy but in rainy season (May-Oct) it only rains for 3-4 hours in the afternoon then stops. It makes everything lush and green which is another reason they call it the city of perpetual roses and eternal spring. It´s a small city so very easily to walk and see everything. If you escape the center of Antigua, you have to go see the little Aldeas around like San Juan del Obispo, Santa Maria de Jesus, Ciudad Vieja and San Pedro de las Huertas for a more local experience. In the surrounding areas there´s Hobbitenagno, Santa Catarina Barahona and the Mayan/catholic diety San Simon in San Andres Itzapa. There´s Iximche nearby which are Maya ruins and Antigua is centrally located to go see other breathtaking spots in Guatemala like Lake Atitlan and Monterrico. The local people are incredibly nice in general and especially to tourists. Antigua itself is very safe with it´s own division of tourist police, among local, state and federal police. Internet can be a challenge sometimes but when I was there in 2022 they started installing Fiber Optic Internet by a company called Innova so it was getting a lot better. There are a few co-working places like Selina and others that cater to digital nomads so if the internet isn´t super fast where you are staying there are a handful of places that have you covered and hopefully more soon with fiber optic internet. If you´re looking for history, beauty, nature and a more peaceful way of life, Antigua is your place! But venture out from the city square because the valley Antigua is in has so much to offer.",

It can get quite cold in the winter (which is June/July/Aug for Europeans). It has great public transport, and apparently is known for its modern urban planning that grew it from a small town in the 1950s to almost 2 million people now. People are friendly, and service is nice, especially if you try speak a bit of Portuguese.

Lots of good, cheap local restaurants where you can eat for $1 if you want. Otherwise, the $10-15 restaurants serve very good food. Adoption of Grab by restaurants is limited, so you will have to go out to eat at those restaurants. If you just want to hustle from home and not waste time going to restaurants, you will feel like you're always eating the same things after a month due to the limited good options. Try the egg coffee and salt coffee, I don't like coffee but found them delicious. Ants are a problem to consider when booking accommodation, it seems the whole city has a problem with that. It's like they live inside the floors and walls of buildings. I wouldn't book an apartment on a low floor. Renting a scooter for a month costs 45 usd for the cheapest kind, which is nice. I recommend you do it as it will open up the city for you, but be careful when riding. You get used to it but half of the top 50 most insane things I have ever seen people do on the road happened here. I recommend doing a day trip to Hoi An, it is a giant tourist trap but it is beautiful. Vietnamese people are not very nice in my experience. Completely different from the lovely Thai people. I'd say they are much closer to the Chinese culturally. I personally view the locals as a bit too inconsiderate and a bit too aggressive for my taste especially when trying to take your money, although if you stand your ground they quickly back down, which I guess means they see it as \"just business\" and there is still a form of underlying respect. But \"just business\" also extends to fake google reviews, misleading photos and descriptions on accommodation listings, convenient order \"mistakes\", 2-3x price gauging, random people trying to charge you for parking your scooter in a public place, and it quickly gets annoying. For these reasons, I do not hold Vietnamese culture in high regard. If you're a young broke backpacker or bootstrapper, I guess it might make sense for you to be here. Otherwise I'd say lower your expectations, or just go somewhere else entirely. When you know you can go to any of the neighbouring countries and be treated much better, why come to Vietnam? Such is the beauty of the free market.",

In the end I spent half on my income every month on rent. And you don't want to live in the dead suburbs. But if you can find a good deal in the center you'll be fine. You can walk everywhere. The public transport is excellent in the rare occasions you need it. It's a walkable and livable city with an extraordinary amount of beautiful architecture and bridges.

Outside the city center, Lublin can be quite underdeveloped, limiting the range of electric scooter rentals to only around 2-3 km from the center.

I strongly recommend a guided tour (about $75) because the trails aren't marked well and the guides are full of useful and interesting information. be prepared though, Cuenca is 2500m (8000 feet) up and Cajas is 4000m (13000 feet) up so you'll definitely feel the altitude.

(not including food courts in malls they are cheap) - If you want to cook the best places to buy food are the fresh markets and wet markets in terms of price. - Stores like Tesco and Big C are cheap but again in the long run it adds up. Attractions - Not too many places to visit here - If you have a car you can go to Buriram to see the historical places like Phanom Rung and other ruins WiFi - A lot of free wifi in the malls and hotels - Hotel wifi - some are good and some are very bad even if it's a higher end hotel wifi can be bad - Mall wifi is fine - connects most of the time and sometimes it cuts off - the speed is okay - I found in general wifi allover the kingdom is pretty much the same in terms of speed and sustained connection",

Bolivians from La Paz are very nice people, a bit more reserved but I was able to make friends anyway. There are no big expats groups / digital nomads, however there are some hostels where one can go for a party and meet some international people. Although the city is pretty small (less than 1 million) it's a good point to see Bolivia and area, it has great culture to explore there are comfortable buses going to Uyuni and other places in Bolivia, so it's a good point to see other parts of Bolivia.

Downside is a lot of the restaurants aren't open and some tours are shut down. Upside is you get to live like a local in a insanely touristy town 10 months of the year. We were able to grab a very nice 1 bedroom apartment in the old town center with a kitchen for 150 euros for 5 nights (30 euros/n). Probably 10-15 restaurants were open in the old town, including the main grocery store. It appeared most everything was getting ready to open for Carnival, which probably marks the end of the lowest season (Few days after New Year's to Carnival). We did all the touristy stuff, and saw no other International travelers but a few random couples and one Chinese tour bus that overnighted (Right as COVID was taking hold...) We walked the walls and saw less than 20 people in 2 hours. If you want to avoid the crowds you can't beat Dubrovnik in the winter.",

For working it wasn't that great, unfortunately, with slow internet and the available coworking spaces not quite as nice as I had hoped. It's still okay though, so not terrible. The city itself is nice. Traffic can be terrible at times and taxi drivers never have change (ugh...) but old town is wonderful and the zocalo super beautiful. There are some nice bars as well. Everything is cheap of course and the locals really friendly. So all in all it depends what you are looking for but if you like nature and speak some amount of Spanish you should consider Arequipa for some time!",

Despite Montegonians warning me about how dangerous it is, using common sense, respecting the locals and their culture, and not being an asshat, unsurprisingly, goes a long way. I'm not big on tourist traps, but stopping by Devon House is a must. If it isn't for the history of its buildings or the beautiful gardens, stop and get an amazing curry goat patty or amazing ice cream. Accommodation costs vary greatly and I've stayed at both the C$80/night Spanish Dream to $300/night at Spanish Court. Longer term stays would benefit greatly from having a local Kingstonian's assistance. Transportation costs also vary based on the honesty of your taxi driver. Locals are generally friendly and I was lucky to have experienced the nightlife from the club scene to outdoor reggae parties, and local dancehall parties. I've never felt unsafe but I was also always with locals who knew their way around the city. Food is amazing and pricing varies greatly as well. The culture is not LGBT friendly and the internet infrastructure is spotty even in the better areas. I often found myself without solid access and simply used it as an excuse to enjoy myself versus working. Definitely a city worth visiting either way.",

At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes. Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food. The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window. In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :). Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there). Now, lets talk about traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore. Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty... You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you. I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them. My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) . Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy. I will return to Bengaluru in the future.",

Also much more difficult than in Rio to stumble into a bad neighbourhood. Lived here for 6 years and never had any problems. I walk and bike everywhere and never felt threatened. Pretty beaches and great access to nature. Good restaurantes, coffee shops, and nightlife. Short on musuems, football games, and big time tourist attractions (although the convent in neighbouring Vila Velha is really spectacular) if that is your thing. Not a huge expat community, but local people are very freindly. Live in Praia do Canto, Jardim da Penha, Jardim Camburi, Enseada do Sua, or across the bridge in Praia da Costa. Nice weather all year round. Pretty rich place, but cost of living much lower than Rio or Sao Paulo.

I walked into a 5 star hotel, stayed 3 days at the regular rate, then negotiated a rate for 30 days... 5 star perks for $29USD a night. I've been here 2 months now. If you're a fan of Art Deco or Art Moderne, this place is great. The city is beginning a modernization process... slowly... just slowly enough. There are 4-5 huge shopping malls (and a couple of dead ones :). The food choices are wide and varied. The core of historic Chinatown, in Kesawan district, is quite the place to shop or eat- there's food, fabric, motorcycles, musical instruments, sports equipment, cell phones (an entire mall for just cell phones). Medan has a LOT of coffee shops, from little carts on the sidewalk to hipster joints in refurbished buildings (and Starbucks). Like the song by 'Missing Persons' says, \"Nobody Walks in Medan\". The scooter and motorcycle rule the road here. Watch where you are walking (sidewalks are a bit rough). Brastagi is the fancy grocery store. Indiatown is wonderful and the restaurant Cahaya Baru is the best Indian food since... well... India. The area was settled by Local Aboriginal Natives, Chinese, and Indians, and there is a great cultural mix with a lot of tolerance today, especially as time moves on from those dark days of the late 1990's Indonesia... out with the old, in with the new...Young people just wanna have fun now. Mosques, temples (Indian, Buddhist, Confucian), churches... Medan really is the most culturally diverse spot in Indonesia. If you want to get off the tourist grid, really off, try Indonesia's 4th largest city. Did I mention the active volcano?",

From here, you can go to the famous Railay beach with a longtail boat within 15 minutes and also the tours to Phi Phi and Hong Island start from here. There is a club called Upbeat Bar/Loft RNB in the middle of Ao Nang that gets kinda busy, although not super crowded in the rainy season. Maybe main season is different. Stay away from Krabi Town however, its just an ugly town without anything to do and its not possible to get a taxi to Ao Nang after 10-11pm. Stay around Ao Nang!",

Visit \"Kul'tura Diktuyet\" in syganak street ten and ask Radmir for a cappuccino. You won't need to find any other coffee place after that.

This bustling city is growing at an impressive rate, showcasing a blend of cultural heritage and modern infrastructure that offers an array of opportunities for visitors. One of the city's key highlights is its small and friendly airport. The Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport is conveniently located, allowing easy access to and from the city. Despite its size, it boasts excellent connectivity with other European destinations, making it a perfect gateway to explore the broader region. Food lovers will be thrilled to discover the authentic Neapolitan Pizzeria NOMO nestled in the city. This eatery takes pride in serving up the finest pizza, prepared following the traditional recipes and techniques from Naples. It's a slice of Italy right in the heart of Rzeszów! Rzeszów is also home to a collection of amusing monuments that add a unique charm to the city. These quirky structures often elicit laughter and make for great photo opportunities, infusing a sense of fun into the city's architectural landscape. However, a point of caution for those browsing the city images on NomadList: many pictures listed under Rzeszów are, in fact, from Warsaw, which may cause confusion. As a community, let's strive to accurately represent the beauty of Rzeszów by voting on the images that truly depict this vibrant city. Rzeszów is indeed on an exciting developmental trajectory. Its growth, combined with its cultural richness and modern amenities, makes it a city to watch out for in the coming years.",

As a disclaimer I happen to be close to fluent in Japanese, and as the metrics here would indicate speaking next to no Japanese might be somewhat difficult, but it's certainly still livable (tons of signage is in English, and there is information on places to go and see in English as well). Also it feels a tad more unexposed in comparison to some of the more major cities, though Fukuoka has a pretty large population at about 1.6 million inhabitants. I find it incredibly affordable (but I hail from NYC), and there is a lot of green space in close proximity to urban areas, which gives the city this really organic feeling to it- the perfect mix of big and small city. Food is without a doubt exceptional. Incredibly rich culinary history and culture here. Coffee is also terrific (may I recommend ManuCoffee? I used to work in a coffee start up and I still think Manucoffee makes one of the best blends I've had the pleasure to drink in a while). As another reviewer stated, these low key coffee places are often optimal for getting work done/studying/etc. and I often frequent them for this reason. I would say of the major Japanese cities is certainly one of the most livable, and with an airport 15 minutes away from the city center by subway it's very accessible and you can quite easily get around to different parts of the country from there. As for cons summers here are quite tough. Brutally humid and hot. Winters then get quite cold, but there's rarely snow. I remember the first time I came here I was visiting as a tourist but even as I work from here the same mellow, free feeling predominates. Lovely, lovely, lovely city.",

A lot of police check on the roads around Patong (and accidents), so always bring your international license. You can make it as expensive (or cheap) as you want, if you eat local like I do a meal is around 60 - 120 baht. Stay away from hostels and meet like minded people in the gym, more luxurious beach clubs and events. Stay away from hostels and cheap guests only coming to party and use drugs. Use common sense.

It's quite lovely all of it, but besides it, the town doesn't offer a lot. However, this part of Bosnia is beautiful and it is possible to see the different places around by staying in Mostar.

Summers are unbearable, but it's possible to be on the sea cost in 45 minutes by car. Services in the restaurants and general communication (busses, cabs, hosts, hospitals, stores) are not satisfactory, but traveling around I figured out they just behave that way, it shouldn't be taken personally.

So many gyms around the city so its easy to keep your exercise routine.

Maybe the most unique city in China. Weather terrible in winter and summer. Winter is foggy, rainy and low light while summers are uncomfortably hot and humid. They don't speak standard Mandarin here so even Chinese from Beijing can't talk to the locals. I had the time of my life here but it's too strange and foreign for many.

It's more modern than some other Arab countries but it is still a male dominant society. Female don't have a very active role in the public Jordanian society. Of course I met many couples where the woman is the dominant one and makes all the desicions, but it is the man that takes action in public. As the minimum national salaries are around 300JD -395 Euros, I was expecting Amman to be cheaper, but surprisingly prices are similar to many Europeans capitals. Just housing can be cheaper depending on neighbourhood. Amman is a dirty, crowded, trafficking and a poor city with some rich well kept neighbours, like Abdoun. There is no much Middle class. It's a big contrast between luxury and poverty. And the government don't seem to care how can people survive with a salary of 300JD while the cheapest house is 300/ 350JD. The wives normally don't work. It's a family support system. Foreigns pay more in places like the Downtown. That used to be a more traditional area and now is more \"modernized\"due to tourism. To avoid male attention, I would recommend woman to just wear big cleavages and mini skirts in clubs and bars, in rich neighbours. Female foreigns are considered easy and promiscuous for having boyfriends and not marrying virgin. Arabs are friendly but that doesn't mean that they like you. They are very envious, love to brag and to show off and the majority is inexperienced. They leave parents home to marry. The ones that studied in university maybe are a bit different. Traffic is crazy and people don't follow any rules. They just respect traffic police and red traffic lights. There are not many public transports . There are buses that are cheap but crowed and just used by poor people. Other option is uber. Taxis can be dirty and taxi drivers may smoke and talk on the phone while driving a client . There is no train or metro. So it's cars and people walking in the middle of the road s there are no side walks or zebras. side walks are used for stores, for trees or parking cars. Amman is not a walkble city. If you have money to spend and just stay around the better areas, you will love Amman.",

There's a well equipped gym, Salsa dancing Night every Monday at the schick-kitsch mexican restaurant, stand up paddle, lots of wonderful yoga shalas, kite surfing, snorkelling, diving and lots of food options. It's actually becoming a vegetarian and vegan paradise lately. There's also a co-working space as part of a Yoga Center. Several music and traditional festivals are held every year and it's wonderful to watch local weddings. Land prices are also still reasonable given that the island will be developing at a faster pace now. The quality of people that seem to crowd Gili Air are very different to those that go to Gili Trawangan. Gili Air attracts a 30+ couples, families and friends groups who don't mind splashing out on nice accommodation, spa treatments and great culinary experiences. All in all, my favorite place so far with an average of 322 days of sunshine! The climate doesn't get any better than this anywhere in the world(and given most other exotic islands are prone to hurricanes... there's never been a hurricane or tornado in the Gilis).",

International food is quite good and you will even find michelen starred restos here. Internet is great, and many cafes or coworking/weworks to work out of. Bogota is a tech capital in latam, so a decent place to farm out work, although dont expect mass english proficiency. Women here are very good looking but more of the \"classy\" type versus the reggaeton video types you see in medellin. If you can find a solid gf/wife you will never leave trust me colombian women are one of a kind. Traffic is some of the worst so make sure you can walk everywhere you gotta go or alternatively only travel outside of rush hour. Has all your favorite apps like uber and rappi as well. Rappi was actually invented here. Where you stay really matters as the class divide in Bogota is huge. Personally lived in Chico which I loved. Other people say rosales is good and if you like suburban life usaquen. South of the city is a no go, and probably a warzone. Night life is decent and has all types from classy to grungy. Chapinero and 85 are good for parties. Careful in chapinero at night, dont drink too much. Safety can be a problem mainly at night but if you live in chico,rosales, usaquen you dont really need to worry so much. Also Bogota is one of the most creative cities not just latam but worldwide. A true haven for artists of all types, big graffiti culture, and a ton of cool museums. Place is generally cheap if you earn dollars, but if you wanna spend big there are places. Also good for people on a budget as well. Weather wise it rains a lot and almost has a permanent \"fall feeling\". If you love fall its the place for you. Pollution can be bad so avoid high traffic areas in rush hour, but rain clears away pollution. For me personally Bogota is a true hidden gem, and an awesome place.",

      "description": "Have been in Weligama since Feb 25th and now I'm still here with the COVID-19 curfew going on. Before the curfew starts I was eager to get out of here because 1) it's too hot mid-day 2) tuktuk drivers are waiting around every corner asking \"tuktuk?\" and always horn at you when you're walking by the street - super annoying and 3) it's difficult to find workable wifi 4) everything just seemed super slow and it was hard to be productive. But after the curfew starts I actually like it way better because 1) the traffic noise dies and 2) I found myself a place with good wifi right next to the beach. The locals (besides pushy tuktuk drivers) are very friendly though often times their English is too limited to understand you but they still pretend they understand just to be \"helpful\". It's also a great place for learning to surf (I made some real improvement with my skills). The nomad cost is not accurate here. Expect similar or slighter lower cost than Chiang Mai, unless you're eating veggie rice and curry every day. In summary it can be good for living and working if you spend the time to find a place with good wifi or get your own boardband.",

Great view of the city. It's hot here. Usually like 35+ degrees. The beach is all industrial. Usually a lot of traffic. In the southern part of the city there are some small hills which are cool but to go anywhere with nice air, cool temperatures and big mountains it's at least an hour south. Sometimes the locals will give you a dirty look but if you smile at them they perk right up and smile back usually. There's not too much going on here in my opinion. But there are tons of nice restaurants with good views and the Tinder game here is strong. It has nice malls - I bought a new apple laptop here - quality is fine. Prices are good. If you like vegetables and non-fried food it can be both expensive and hard to find. All in all it's a pretty cool city. I could stay here but I've decided to move to Bandung instead with hopes of more green space, less expensive rent and a cooler climate.",

Here’s why: Grenoble boasts an excellent 5G network, which is crucial for remote work. The internet speed is fast and reliable, so you won’t have to worry about connectivity issues during video calls or while uploading large files. This solid infrastructure has been a game-changer for my productivity. The city is very eco-friendly. With numerous pedestrian zones and a comprehensive system of shared bikes and scooters, getting around is easy and green. I love that I can choose to walk or bike almost anywhere, reducing my carbon footprint while enjoying the fresh air. One of the standout features of Grenoble is its tap water. It’s not only safe to drink but also considered among the best in the world. Having clean, high-quality water readily available is a huge plus. For outdoor enthusiasts, Grenoble is a paradise. Nestled in the Alps, the city offers breathtaking views and endless opportunities for adventure. In the winter, skiing at nearby resorts like Alpe d'Huez and Les Deux Alpes is a must. In the warmer months, I’ve enjoyed hiking, canyoning, and rock climbing. The view from the Bastille is particularly stunning, offering a panoramic glimpse of the city and surrounding mountains. Culturally, Grenoble is vibrant and full of life. The city is home to over 34 museums, numerous theaters, and a host of festivals throughout the year. The large student population injects a youthful energy into the city, making it a lively place to live. Finding a place to work is never an issue here. There are plenty of coworking spaces and cozy cafes where you can set up your laptop. The local university adds an intellectual vibe, and I’ve met many other remote workers, making it easy to build a professional network. Food lovers will be in heaven in Grenoble. The local cuisine is delicious, with specialties like gratin dauphinois and walnuts from the region. But what really sets Grenoble apart is its craft breweries. The city is dotted with numerous artisanal breweries offering unique local beers. Visiting these breweries has become one of my favorite pastimes. Additionally, the local markets, like the Hoche Market and Les Halles Sainte Claire, are perfect for picking up fresh, high-quality produce. Despite the relatively high cost of living (around $2973 per month), the quality of life in Grenoble is exceptional. The modern infrastructure, combined with the natural beauty and cultural richness, makes it a fantastic place to live and work. In summary, Grenoble is an ideal destination for digital nomads. The combination of reliable internet, eco-friendly transport options, incredible outdoor activities, rich cultural scene, and outstanding local cuisine makes it a unique and compelling choice. If you’re looking for a place that balances work and leisure perfectly, Grenoble should definitely be on your list.",

I did a hotel stay as the prices were a tiny percentage of the same accomodation in Mumbai. Internet was good. Tunnel worked here (but that may just have been my access point). There are internet cafes (Cafe Coffee is one)... but there is also Starbucks. Prices at restaurants are lower than other spots I visited in India. I did not do the street food here, but thats just me. By nature this is a very vegetarian region of India, so be prepared... however, they sure can cook, so you may not miss it. I came in by train from Mumbai, but the airport has a fancy new (and empty) terminal. Get around by UBER or Auto (tuk-tuk), but you need cash for the latter. There was flooding in August, the month before I arrived, but all was well by early September... keep an eye on the monsoon forecast. The historic sites are stunning, the mosaic tile work, etc at the palaces... and please realize that they were only built around 1900 (yes that palace photo above in Nomadlist is a building built in 1900 by a British architect, not 500 or 1000 years earlier... but it IS gorgeous in person).

Temperatures usually are between 20 and 30 Celsius during the day, and the sky is almost always clear. The sunsets are gorgeous, and there is a riverbank corridor that runs through the city where you can walk for 20 kilometres along the river and never cross a street (it's called the Meewasin... If you like nature, you will want to book a place near it). Bring bug spray, as there are lots of mosquitos in the summer, especially in the evening. During the summer, there is also a lot more to do--there are often festivals like the jazz festival, the Fringe (theatre), Taste of Saskatchewan, etc. There is not a ton of nightlife or other things to do--there are a couple of museums and art galleries, but it's a very small town feel. Like everywhere in Canada, it's generally safe, LGBTQ friendly, and multicultural. It's safe for minorities, although we have racism like everywhere (and Indigenous people--women in particular--have to be careful walking alone at night). As a white woman, I have walked anywhere I want at all times of day or evening for my whole life, and not had a problem (although I have a high threshold for risk). Canadian culture (prairie culture in particular) is polite and kind (you will be helped if you are in trouble) but reserved. Making friends requires some kind of \"in\" (like attending a mutual event or a shared sport or something like that. There are no dangerous bugs or wildlife (there are bears if you travel to camp--and there is much gorgeous scenery nearby). There are three good co-working spaces, currently. Two on Broadway (that is the trendy artsy area), and one downtown (called the Two Twenty). The Stand on Broadway is my top recommendation for a cheap place to get wifi and work, and the Two Twenty is the most established and the nicest.",

Drivers have exceptional road awareness. It's just that it's scary doing 75 km/h in a bumper to bumper traffic jam. Being a pedestrian is scary as cars have right of way.

I live here, and honestly, it's a decent cheap Canadian capital, I can live while doing my hobby here, and sharing a house. It could be a lot worse if you're thinking of coming to Canada for a while, rent can be found relatively low cost and utilities are cheap too. Meals vary, of course the locals know where the good cheap places are, I like the $5 tacos at BMC market. It is flat and very cold in the winter so do be prepared, Winnipeg is merciless that way.",

It's a hotter town than Austin, not just in temperature, but also in terms of friendliness, activities, family values, and cultural richness (with authentic tacos of all types, Tex-Mex, Cali style, and from Mexico City), it has one of the best culinary and cocktail scenes in the country. It's one of the most affordable for millennials in the States with rich multicultural diversity, being predominantly Hispanic and inclusive. Many are bilingual in Spanish, but English is predominant as anywhere else in the States. From aviation (first military flight) to tech (the invention of the microprocessor), and even Hollywood (the first Best Picture), San Antonio has been home to many firsts. The spirit of these firsts has continued through the ages. Nowadays, there are incredibly fast internet speeds thanks to Google Fiber in many parts of town, San Antonio has all the ingredients for a booming creative economy due to a convergence of incentives in film, gaming, and traditional arts. Downtown San Antonio has old Spanish-architecture, mixed with colorful murals by local artists, and southern Texan charm, but it's the beautiful people who really make the town flourish.",

Clearwater Beach was rated #1 beach in the US multiple years in a row by TripAdvisor, and for good reason. The sunsets are spectacular, water warm as bath water the majority of the year, and sand so soft and fine it’s like corn starch. Great sports town if you like sports, with pro teams in the NHL. MLB, and NFL that consistently perform well. Skyline is beautiful and there are many great restaurants. Temperatures are comfortable year-round, and Tampa Bay is the “sweet spot” in Florida for avoiding hurricanes because of the jet stream and avoiding heat discomfort in the summer because of the wonderful cross-breezes that blow the humidity away. I highly recommend the Tampa Bay Area if you can afford it!",

      "description": "Lake Balaton is Eastern Europe's treasure, an expansive freshwater lake that offers a medley of activities and experiences for both tourists and the growing nomadic community. But there are a few pointers and oddities that digital nomads, in particular, should be aware of. 🌍 **Neighbourhood Map Inaccuracy** Firstly, I was quite surprised to find that NomadList's neighbourhood map for Lake Balaton is somewhat inaccurate. For a start, it glaringly omits Siófok, which is probably the largest city by the lake. Siófok isn't just a popular summer destination but an essential point of reference for anyone considering Lake Balaton as a potential remote work destination. 👩‍💻 **Co-working Spaces** To my knowledge, the region's most notable coworking space is \"AZ iroda - Közösségi Iroda, Coworking Office Balaton\", conveniently located in Balatonfüred. It's a charming, functional space that adds a touch of modernity to the largely traditional locale. 🏖️ **Attractions & Activities** Lake Balaton has a range of neighbourhoods, each brimming with its unique attractions. Swimming, fishing, and sailing are the staples here, with the lake's calm waters inviting all and sundry. For the thrill-seekers, the hyper jet 800 HP boat tours offer an adrenaline-infused experience of the lake's vastness. As the sun sets, the lakeside towns, each with their distinct character, beckon with their laid-back vibes and scenic views. 📡 **Connectivity** If you're relying on internet connectivity, here's the deal: Mobile internet speeds are impressive if you're equipped with an EU SIM. However, WiFi in public places, cafes, and hotels can often be disappointingly slow. So, a good cellular data plan would be your best bet. 👩‍💼 **Nomadic Potential** Despite its charm, Lake Balaton hasn't become a hotspot for digital nomads. Perhaps it's the tranquillity or the seasonal attractions, but it feels more like a place for relaxation and holidays than intense productivity. That said, its serenity, combined with its budding infrastructure, gives it untapped potential. 🕰️ **A Blast From the Past** A peculiar charm of some parts of Lake Balaton is that they feel as if they've been preserved in amber since 1989. This has both its pros and cons. On the upside, there's an authentic, untouched feel to these places. However, the flip side is that they might lack some modern amenities that digital nomads take for granted. Most people are super friendly, more friendly in ex eastern block countries, however some are still stuck in homo sovieticus mindset. Also there are some tourist traps, beware. **Verdict**: Lake Balaton, with its quaint towns and vast expanses of freshwater, is more of a holiday destination than a digital nomad hotspot. But with a few tweaks and broader awareness, this Hungarian gem could shine brighter in the nomadic world. For now, it remains a delightful secret, ideal for relaxation and short-term stays. ⭐⭐⭐☆☆",

      "description": "I recently visited Amsterdam for the third time (and the first time since 2018). I personally think it's a little overrated, but a cool place to visit nonetheless. The architecture is beautiful, and there are lots of good places to eat. I don't like the main area of the canals in the city centre; it smells of weed and is often packed. However, the outer edges - such as the Jordaan district - are less busy and more interesting in my opinion. One thing that surprised me is how much trash was on the streets. Many bins were full, and there was waste - such as abandoned mattresses - in a lot of areas. Some people have said this is because of the bottle deposit initiative and people looking through the trash, but I live in Copenhagen and we have this... yet the city is much cleaner IMO. If you visit, try to come on a weekday. Also, the streets near the canals can be quite chaotic with bikes, cars, and scooters. Again, I'm used to bikes as I live in Copenhagen and cycle myself - but it's much more organised than in Amsterdam IMO. Pros: - Beautiful architecture - The people are nice - Efficient public transport - Good food and nightlife Cons: - Very dirty - Crowded in the central parts - Can feel quite chaotic I would recommend visiting Amsterdam, but I don't know if I would personally live there. The Netherlands has plenty of places that are just as beautiful and interesting, such as Utrecht, Leiden, and Haarlem. I would also recommend visiting The Hague and Rotterdam, even though both cities are perhaps not as pleasing on the eye. TL;DR: Nice place to visit, but I would not live here.",

While, unlike Beijing, you will probably never encounter a single English speaker, you can experience a very similar lifestyle as Beijing at a fraction of the cost. Baoding has a great shopping mall (Wanbo Square) that has any kind of food you could want. Realistically, you could stay in a great hotel for somewhat cheap for a couple months at a time. You could also choose to stay in an AirBnb as many of the apartments are relatively new and clean on the inside-- but as with all individual lodgings, as with all private residences in China, as a foreigner you MUST register with the local police within a day of arrival. I've never experienced any trouble with Baoding law enforcement while registering. If you want to experience unique parts of Beijing, traveling over to Beijing is extremely cheap-- less than $10 USD for the high speed rail. tldr: comparatively inexpensive and good quality life, some grasp of Chinese is a must, follow local laws.",

Most people have never seen a foreigner and are very happy to be your friend. They'll never ask anything of you and actually, will want to pay EVERYTHING for you. Your drinks, your food... no way a Pakistani is gonna let you pay. Lahore is an amazing town with lots to discover and an amazing culture. The downsides are the heavy pollution, not only the air, but also the trash people leave on the streets. Cars keep honking at each other for fun, including noise pollution.

      "description": "I loved my stay in Austin. I had heard a lot of people moved here during COVID and wanted to see it for myself. We stayed around Lady Bird Lake, like on the south side of the river, a very nice area. We were there in July so it was quite hot, but in the shadow it was fine to walk. It is dry heat, not like in Thailand, so while it's hot it's not sweaty which is much better. The average quality of food here is very high, like some of the best food I had in the world besides maybe Japan. Not everything is great of course but just the average level is much higher than other places in US or the world. People are generally very friendly. There is some thing where they say Austinites are friendly but behind the facade mean. I did see this sometimes but not a lot. One thing that helps is that a lot (maybe most?) people here are import from other places. Especially in the last few years. So people are quite open to meeting new people and making friends. People generally are VERY FIT here. You see women walk in Lululemon everywhere, and guys also shirtless and in shorts. Everyone here seems like they're fit and active. Lots of runners. Also everyone seems to have a dog here and they walk it. People also seemed quite individualistic here like you see a lot of people here walk alone, drive alone, sit alone, go places alone. Much more than other US cities, and the rest of the world. Maybe that's a part of people being new here and not having lots of friends yet. Or maybe it means it's hard to make friends here, I am not sure yet. It seems to me it'd be easy to make friends here if you just put effort in like go into your work, hobby or sports subculture. Austin feels very tech-y now, lots of people you overhear talking about building startups and business here. You see lots of money, rich people, expensive cars, but not in an annoying way. There's lots of shopping, all the big brands are here, some good malls although there has to be more I think. South of Congress Avenue (SoCo) is a place we kept going, a nice area with shopping, food and good coffee. Also much further drive 20 minutes up is The Domain, also nice area. We went shooting at The Range, very cool experience. And we went to Sandbox VR in The Domain which was fun too. One thing is, but maybe American problem, it was hard to find good healthy food. We did find Sweet Green which seemed to be relatively healthiest option. But most food here is great but not so healthy if you eat out every day. I guess you really have to rent a place here and cook. I think it's a great city to live if you are single and looking for a fit boyfriend or girlfriend. But also great if you're in a relationship because there's so much stuff to eat, drink and do here. One thing that was VERY bad is the homeless people. They were in downtown and it was very scary seeing them do drugs right on the street and you have to pass them. Problem is they're NOT JUST in downtown in Austin, they're kinda everywhere. Not like A LOT. But also not nothing either. You'll hear random homeless shouting or standing in the middle of the road. Sometimes you're surrounded by homeless and you can't cross the street and it's scary af. They're not harmless homeless either, they will spot you and come up to you and shout at you. Very creepy. I really think the city should clean that up and take the homeless of the streets and help them. And don't let them get back on. It's dangerous for people and children and it makes the city look really bad. Austin is walkable and very good for bicycling, but random homeless make that more dangerous. I guess that's one reason why running clubs are so big here because people feel safer running in a massive group. All around I do think it's a GREAT city and a great place to live or visit. It's one of my top places I've lived in the world and it is very comfortable and nice.",

Because it's a student town there's also a lot to do here, even for non-students. By West-European standards the prices are reasonable. Pretty much everyone speaks English fairly well, and Dutch is not too hard to pick up on. The location of Leiden in the Netherlands is also neat: 10 min by train to The Hague, 20-ish to Schiphol Airport, 30 min to Rotterdam, 40-ish min to Amsterdam and Utrecht. The biggest drawback I can think of is the fact that the housing market is very oversaturated because of the number of students who live here, so it might be tough to find a place to stay.",

If you want decent quality food, it won't be much cheaper than back home. Many restaurants have an order card, so if you can't speak chinese you can grab the card and a pencil and use your phone to translate the card and tick off what you want - easy as. - Nightlife is based around night markets, KTV, places to \"hang out\" etc with a handful of decent bars/clubs around if you're into that. - Traffic is much safer than countries in SEA but still not perfect. - Very hot in summer but winter has good temperatures (although increased pollution in winter). Lots of sunshine most of the year with little rain/clouds which is nice. - Internet is fine and it's easy to get an unlimited data sim for around 700NTD/month and hotspot yourself if you need it . - All healthcare professionals speak some degree of english.",

Other than that there's not much to do other than enjoy the views of the Detroit skyline from the riverwalk. I always feel safe in Windsor. Like most of Canada, Windsor is expensive, but internet service and other infrastructure are great for working. Winters are extreme. Some Canadians have anti-American attitudes, unfortunately.

Also, as they hire local drivers ( natives), you help the local community. Tip: Take the Blue Line, get out at Sea Life Park, and walk to Makapu’u Beach. It is a beach frequented by locals, so you will be off the beaten track. Return to Waikiki with The Bus ( local city bus). Groceries: choose the ABC Store. They are everywhere on the island!!

There are a wonderful selection of forests and parks just about everywhere, and the museums can't be beat. There's always something to do - too many choices!

Anywhere you go you can drink tap water, even once I was in Daaibooi Beach which is 30 km away from the main city and I asked the guy at the snack bar to fill my bottle and the water was as nice as downtown !! Amazing !! If you are a bike rider (bicycle), forget it ! You will get killed, there is no shoulder, neither sidewalks. Some roads looks like Beyrouth at a certain era, but in general they are ok. Stray dogs are everywhere. Every family ther has at least 2 dogs, and at night, you sometimes feel like Kevin Costner in Dances with wolves with all the dogs barking at the moon. Nothing grows there, but cactus do!! I crashed my drone in the 'forest' and I worked very hard to bring it back ! And I agree, if you are not a freak like I am, you will need a car.",

Cost of living is dirty cheap and public transport is good. They even have a subway crossing the city with reminds me the BTS in Bangkok. Actually, Kochi to me is like a small and boring version of Bangkok, which is good if you need a cheap place to get the work done while enjoy the sunsets and South Indian food.",

The juxtaposition of old and new, rich and poor, high-end retail and street fare was something to see. Apparently one of the cheapest places to rent in India, although I fell back on a hotel (I know, not very nomad).... Still, it was not bad. Internet was fast enough for research and posting work, but there are filters on access in various places in India, so for example I couldn't get my Tunnel to function here (may have just been my chosen access points filtered it). There are internet cafes (Starbucks, etc) in the Park Street area that I could use. English is widely (but NOT universally) understood, but you will also run up against Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu. The food is fabulous, with every possibility you can imagine (oh yeah, nice brewpubs and pizza for the unadventurous). Even if you are not a vegetarian, trust me, these folks can cook in ways that you won't miss meat (and this from a guy who likes BBQ). Currency exchange is best done at a bank, don't trust the ATM's that are stuck to the side of a building. Although the NomadList says otherwise, I was able to use my plastic for a lot of purchases- India is pretty progressive depending on where you are. Use a \"Prepaid taxi\" to get from the airport to town, which you can get from a booth inside the main terminal... Don't use UBER at the airport as the crazy insanity of the pickup area makes getting your ride nearly impossible (otherwise UBER in Kolkata is fine). I miss Kolkata, I will be back.",

I walked a lot around town, and it was perfectly safe. There are even some pedestrian zones with no traffic. Erlangen should have a really high score in this category- it's not exactly a big town where getting around on foot just isn't reasonable. You can alternatively ride a bike pretty much anywhere. Getting in and around town is also possible with public transport - trains and buses which are reliable, affordable, and convenient. Also, it was super easy to make friends... if you make an effort. If you walk around being very loud and drawing attention to yourself, locals will shy away from you. Once you make an effort to meet locals, there is plenty to do. It's not a touristy town so it's easy to miss all the fun that's available. If you happen to be in Erlangen during the annual Bergfest (the 3rd largest beer festival in all of Germany), you're in for a real treat. The only real downside is the weather - it does get really cold, and stay cold for too long.",

Most people go from A/C to A/C venues anyhow. The beaches and ocean are magical, the tours to the islands are so inexpensive and you have unique experiences diving, swimming, and meeting new people. In the tourist areas people will speak more English, but then again, you are in their country, there are many apps to help translate.

Nevertheless, basically no one speaks English. There is a large mall with several options to eat and work. I've spent days in local cafes without issue although cafe owners were clearly surprised by this behaviour. Regarding activities, they are constrained to the touristic, such as museums, and hamams (saunas). I've heard that there are pubs and places to dance but I've not seen them. The female population mostly behaves as small town people. Caring about appearances and stuff like that. Be extremely careful with traffic! No rules are respected. Finally, this nation has an honor culture, like all of the region. Do no criticize anyone for anything!",

One of the few British seaside towns which does not feel like a retirement home. Due to universities, it has a large amount of young people from continental Europe and South America.

It's not a metropolis, but that small-town feel is precisely what gives Deventer its unique character. In recent years, the city has been buzzing with a growing selection of shops and restaurants and small little niche stores! One of my favorite things to do in Deventer is to visit the bustling Saturday market. It's a feast for the senses, with local vendors offering everything from fresh produce and flowers to handcrafted goods. I also love to stroll through the city park, a peaceful oasis in the heart of Deventer. Whether you're visiting for a day of shopping, a culinary adventure, or simply to soak up the relaxed atmosphere, Deventer has something for everyone. The weekly markets on Fridays and Saturdays are a true delight, showcasing local produce and crafts. And for those working remotely: Deventer offers plenty of inspiring spots to set up your laptop, including the vibrant Havenkwartier, a creative hub with trendy cafes and unique shops. The city has become a magnet for people escaping the hustle and bustle of the big city's Such as Amsterdam or Rotterdam, without sacrificing vibrancy. The entrepreneurial spirit is thriving, adding to Deventer's dynamism. And as soon as the sun comes out you can enjoy at the IJssel River, where you can unwind and enjoy the views. Deventer is a hidden gem that hasn't yet been overrun by tourists. A city where you immediately feel at home and where there's always something new to discover. An undiscovered pearl that's definitely worth a visit!",

For the most part, it's orientated around suburbian living. The main city (Johannesburg CBD) is for the most part a no-go because of crime, but if you know some locals you should definitely check it out there are amazing restaurants, theatres and museums to experience there. Having lived here for 30+ years, I'd recommend checking out Sandton CBD, restaurants in Linden, Wanderers and Bryanston, and rent a car to drive out to The Cradle of Humankind, and visit the Maropeng museum there. There is a lot to do here, you just need to think and act like a local.

Prepaid taxi from the airport is my usual recommendation, and if I was traveling tomorrow that is what I would do. Inside of Mumbai, UBER was my go-to app and worked well. Autos (aka 'Tuk-tuks' in some places) get around well and are cheap, some are also on Uber. Be aware that unless you use a service like UBER, as a foreigner, the price will go up if you do not look and act like a local when you flag down your ride. Food was varied and can be had in any variety, veg or non=veg, any nationality or region. Alcohol is available if you seek it out (some places will even deliver it to you with your pizza :). There are bars and night life in Mumbai that are fun, and feel free to get swept up in festival crowds in the earlier parts of the evening in major metropolitan areas. I never felt unsafe in Mumbai, but do not throw good traveler caution to the wind here. Internet was spotty at times, but that may have just been my location. The internet tunnel I used worked, but YMMV. JIO was my phone provider of choice, and it seemed to work all across India. The city is historic and modern, slow and fast, very very rich, and desperately poor. Although prices here are higher relative to all other places in India, I will return to Mumbai (Bombay), and you should too... no one person can ever see it all.",

I saw 10 for 3 pounds in many flavours, raisins, chocolate, cinnamon, lemon the list goes on. next you need to go to Cardiff castle (it can be pricey) during normal session it costs 13 pound a person but during popular events like football it is often free to visit and climb the castle which is what I did during a football game in the millennium stadium and yes it does get crowded when these games are on but the good thing being in the city the roads close so people can walk on the roads making it easier to not get stepped on. while here you need to try a nice pub at least one time while I cant remember the name there is a lovely cocktail bar/pub that does 2 for 1 cocktails for 7 pound (my favourite being buffalo soldier (which is rum, ginger beer and apple juice with lime added and its delicious). when you are here make sure you check out the welsh gift shops and get a few souvenirs here, the amount of highly detailed and shiny dragon statues you can buy are insane so if you like castles, medieval literature and dragons (and sheep) make sure you come to Cardiff for a break from London.",

Lachania, Vati, Mesanagros and Arnitha all have beautiful squares with wifi where you can telework sitting in a kafeneio under the shade of a tree. In Vati there is free 5G in the square and no car in sight. You might see fallow deers grazing around. Perfect place to concentrate. Platanos taverna offers great home made food from April to November. It can get cold in winter and insulation and heating are hard to find. There are many stray cats in poor welfare and also suffering stray dogs. Driving is a bit aggressive. Alternative lifestyles are tolerated but not really accepted. However attitudes are improving fast.",

I went skiing, checked out the town center and so much more! I was so hooked with this place and did not want to leave! I sadly had to.

The flow of life is easy because I take with myself the backpack with the computer to a cafe by Ganga and have some nice healthy breakfast, at 08:00 am, and work to about 10:30. Then i go to Sachcha Dham Ashram join a Bhajans and listen to Satsang from my Guru there. Then i go out with my friends to a nice place to spend the day. Other days i work after that to about 5 Pm, and walk to Parmarth Niketan Ashram for som Bhajans and Satsang, and maybe a session of Yoga to, before i go to an restturant and have an evening meal before going home. Now that i am older an have traveled on and off for over twenty years, i have found my home in Rishikesh, and i am suppriced that there is not more Digital Nomads there than it is, but i am pretty shure that that will change in the future :)",

The only things I learned from my time and would think about next time: - if you go in May, you will wish you had air conditioning because it gets pretty hot in the evenings and the city is lively, so you'll hear all of the happenings if you're relying on open windows, and you'll wake up with lots of mosquito bites - Bed bugs were a thing more than I would have expected - I had a friend visit and get them from their airbnb, and two other friends who also got bed bugs from their spot, so keep an eye out.",

Many biking roads start in Biarritz and wind up into Pyrenees. There is always plenty to do here, and international festivals abound, so do surfing and swimming competitions. How about helicopter tour or airplane free fall? Salt water swimming pool. Miles of fabulous sandy beaches and dunes. We have wonderful farmer's markets, luxury clothing stores, local creators, theater with very high quality ballet troupe, opera directly from the METH, wonderful food, nightclubs, museums... Prices are very reasonable for France, and almost everybody speaks English, French and Spanish. You can live on shabby-chic or extreme luxury, what every your budget allows. High speed internet, city wide Wi-Fi coverage. People are very friendly, both locals and transplanted ones. Oh yeah, just 25km from San Sebastian in Spain. International airport with direct flights to many European capitals, train to Bordeaux and Paris in a few hours... I can't imagine better place to live and work - except maybe Kauai island.",

Much lower than shopping at Whole Foods and probably by now, even Trader Joes. Eating out, well, it can cost you a lot but there are so many affordable options. Rents can be high but again, there are many apartments that are reasonable if you are renting year-round. We have been renting Airbnb's during the winter months, from October to February, and were able to get a beautiful sea view one-bedroom for $1200. Another AirBnb a bit higher up again, for $1200. We splurged on a place with a large terrace and beautiful mountain view for $2300. But it was worth it! $2300 was about what my mortgage was in Chicago. According to Numbeo, cost of living here is around $4100 for a family of four. By the way, Cannes is gorgeous with a sandy, accessible beach, people are very friendly, and it is meticulously maintained. We have been to Aix-en-Provence, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nice, Bordeaux and of course Paris, but have chosen Cannes to live. It is more expensive than Montpellier and perhaps Bordeaux, but not more than Nice or certainly Aix. Aix I found to be the most expensive after Paris.",

I loved the old section of town and being able to walk everywhere. I was surprised to see Annecy received a low rating for being family-friendly. I saw lots of families engaged in fun activities, and puppeteers putting on shows for children. When I took a boat tour on the lake, I saw young children and teens enjoying a swim; in town, I saw children of all ages riding their bicycles around. Annecy is in good proximity to Chamonix and the French Alps. The countryside is very scenic and the Gorges du Fier is beautiful. For the most part, I wouldn't say the people were that friendly. However, I made friends with a woman who lived upstairs from the VRBO I rented. We still Skype to this day, but I have noticed that she often has difficulty with her internet connection. I really enjoyed visiting Annecy and hope to return again soon.",

The one major con is the air pollution—it can get really bad, so beware. Throughout my time in Beijing, I was constantly discovering new places and meeting interesting people. When I was there, there were plenty of foreigners and people were mostly very welcoming towards us. It's a special place. There are also loads of cafes and bars where you can work from, with good internet. A must-visit is the Friends Cafe—it's modelled after Central Perk from the sitcom Friends. They have good internet, delicious coffee and snacks, and Friends is playing on the TV 24/7! Disclaimer: Not sure if it's still in operation now.",

      "description": "Bocas del Toro is an awesome place to come and work at. There are different places to stay and work in Bocas del Toro, throughout the archipelago that offer different experiences. Some places are more remote with high speed internet service, comfortable settings just a bit far so getting into town and enjoying the nightlife can be more difficult. If you want to stay in town there are some options in Bocas Town with co-working spaces like Selinas Hostel, but keep in mind there is a lively nightlife there, so this is great for meeting people but maybe not the best for a quiet night. Some places out of town are Saigon Bay just a few minutes outside of of the center of town. There you can find some quiet bed and breakfasts offering longer term rental options as well as vacation rentals and Airbnbs. Some nice options over Saigon Bay include: Over Water Rentals, Saigon Bay Bed & Breakfast and Barrbara Bed and Breakfast. Further out towards Bluff Beach there are some super cute options like Somewhere or Nowhere, as well as Nomad Tree Lodge, Hummingbird Bed and Breakfast as well as other super cute Airbnbs, keep in mind the further out you are, the higher the chances of having bad internet connection are. Make sure to ask about their internet provider, there are some really good ones that work even in remote areas of Bocas. Lots of restaurants and cafes offer comfortable places to work as well with great internet and excellent dishes and coffees. Try places such as Cafe del Mar, Super Gourmet, and Buena Vista Restaurante. Nightlife and activities are abundant. You will never be bored in Bocas del Toro. After working, enjoy activities such as surfing, bike riding, explore the beaches and reefs, for paddling, go sailing, etc. You can also learn Spanish, look for Habla Ya Spanish Schools they have some great longer term programs. Bocas del Toro is a great spot for digital nomads, you should definitely check this place out!",

You can literally hike a gorgeous mountain walking about 5 minutes south of the old city center. It's also the most central location to visit nearby castles and national parks. You can buy tickets online and the trains are easy to navigate to get to places like Peles Castle in an hour or so. Highly recommend staying here a couple weeks! I hope to return.",

Love the vintage stores and antique shops too. Sunsets on the lake are a treasure. Gauchos are the most \"talkative\" people I've ever met in my life (and I am a world traveler who has lived in other countries). Being chatty isn't a bad thing, but the problem here is that the vast majority of people only talk about THEMSELVES. Oftentimes, non-stop. They don't ask questions about you because they have no interest. It's about showing off where they've eaten, traveled, studied, etc. Even the taxi and Uber drivers behave in this manner. Living in a city full narcissists / braggarts gets draining. After years of being here, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's cultural (not malicious). Aside from this, they are very nice people. NOTE: In the countryside, the Gauchos tend to be polite, modest, and well-mannered.",

The area has moved away from the large-scale industry which has all but abandoned the area and now experiences a lot of growth through local entrepreneurs including a rich culture of Craft Beer brewing, tattoo shops, cafes, music, and a variety of other \"fun\" businesses. While Dayton, itself, is growing fast and the housing prices can be extremely cheap, one will find that the surrounding suburbs host a large portion of the local population and are not lacking in entertainment or cultural life. The metroparks are outstanding and bike trails are rapidly tying various areas together. Technology-wise, the area has two universities and a large Air Force base so one would find mostly enterprise-level organizations. There is a lot of potential to grow the local technology scene and Dayton hosts one of the largest HAM Radio festival annually.",

Pros: -beautiful surroundings just walking around -walkable as long as you don’t have limitations -a lot of cute hidden gems within the buildings -outside the city center there are options for horseback riding and hiking - Feels safe Cons (city center): - not a lot to do other than shop and eat - Overrun by tourists on the weekends - Church bells ring every 15 minutes (not exaggerating) all day and night - Random firecrackers and fireworks in the middle of the night - More expensive than CDMX",

      "description": "Hello to everyone ! 🤟 I'm Seb Fourault , entrepreneur and digital nomad who has made Guadeloupe my place of life, as well as my entrepreneurial playground. I want to share with you my experience and my discoveries on this magnificent island, which I see as a true paradise for all entrepreneurs and digital nomads from around the world. Guadeloupe, with its idyllic climate, its rich culture and its strategic proximity to Europe and America, offers an exceptional living and working environment. Here, I found the perfect balance between work, leisure and discovery, in a stimulating and welcoming environment. In this guide, I will tell you about everything you need to know to succeed as an entrepreneur or digital nomad in Guadeloupe: from the economic climate to available subsidies , including incubators , coworking spaces , and of course, the cultural and social aspects that make this island unique. My objective ? Convince you that Guadeloupe is not just a holiday destination, but a real hub for entrepreneurs and digital nomads, comparable to places like Dubai, Bali or Thailand , with a unique French touch 🇫🇷 So, ready to dive into the Guadeloupean adventure? Follow me, and let's find out together how to make this island your next office paradise! PS: This article is the fruit of my personal experience and information collected during my adventures in Guadeloupe, it is of course not an absolute truth and I do not claim that it covers all aspects. It will evolve as I discover, meet and receive your feedback. I hope it will be useful and inspiring to you! 😊 In the program : Guadeloupe, an Eden for Digital Entrepreneurs Understanding the Economic Climate in Guadeloupe Moving to Guadeloupe: Practical Aspects Subsidies and Support for Entrepreneurs Networks and Communities for Entrepreneurs in Guadeloupe Life in Guadeloupe: An Ideal Working Climate My Personal Tips on the Specificities of Guadeloupe Guadeloupe, an Eden for Digital Entrepreneurs Guadeloupe is much more than a postcard of beaches and palm trees. It is a dynamic ecosystem, conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship. Let me tell you why this island is a top choice for digital entrepreneurs. Climate and Environment: Imagine working with a view of the Caribbean Sea, surrounded by lush nature. Guadeloupe offers a pleasant tropical climate all year round, similar to Bali or Thailand, but with a major advantage: the stability and security of a French department. Cultural Diversity and Strategic Proximity: Here you benefit from a unique blend of Caribbean and European cultures. Proximity to Europe and North America is a major advantage for business, especially with direct flights from the United States significantly reducing travel time. An Innovation Hub: Guadeloupe is not left out in terms of technology and innovation. With local initiatives and support from the French government, the island is positioning itself as a growing technology hub. In short, Guadeloupe offers an exceptional living environment, combined with a stimulating business environment. It is fertile ground for digital entrepreneurs looking to combine quality of life and professional opportunities. Understanding the Economic Climate in Guadeloupe As an entrepreneur who took his first steps in Guadeloupe, I can assure you that the island's economy is as rich as its biodiversity. Here's a look at what you need to know about the local economic climate. A Diversified Economy: Guadeloupe is not limited to tourism. Agriculture, renewable energy, and information technology are booming sectors. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Islands of Guadeloupe (CCI IG), among others, offers support to entrepreneurs. Government Support: As a French department, Guadeloupe benefits from subsidies and support from the French state, particularly for new businesses and innovative projects. This includes financial aid as offered by BPI France , advice on business creation, and professional training. A Dynamic Market on an advantageous Geographical location: The local population is receptive and demanding new technologies and innovations. Additionally, the island's geographic position provides easy access to American and European markets. Time difference, an advantage? Most digital nomads who choose to emigrate to Asia complain that their clients in mainland France call on them until late in the evening, pushing them to work long days. Here we are positioned in the other direction, we tend to get up a little earlier, which is not disturbing because the sun rises early, and from midday we are quiet and we can work without distraction because the metropolis has gone to bed (or go and enjoy the beach, your choice 😁). Personally, I find it a real comfort for work/life balance and mental workload. Challenges to Face: Like any region, Guadeloupe has its challenges, particularly in terms of logistics and infrastructure (water, ecology, energy, transport, access to care, etc.). However, these challenges also represent opportunities for resourceful entrepreneurs. In summary, Guadeloupe offers a dynamic and diverse economic environment, with significant support for entrepreneurs. It’s fertile ground for those looking to innovate and grow in a tropical setting. To find out more: the CCI website . Moving to Guadeloupe: Practical Aspects Moving to Guadeloupe as an entrepreneur or digital nomad requires good preparation. Here are some practical tips based on my personal experience and information gathered during my meetings. Administrative Formalities: As a French department, Guadeloupe follows the same administrative rules as mainland France. For EU citizens, installation is relatively simple, especially for healthcare professionals. For others, a visa may be necessary. It is important to contact the nearest French embassy or consulate to find out the specific procedures. Accommodation: Finding accommodation in Guadeloupe can be a challenge, especially during peak tourist season. Villa rentals are popular among expats and digital nomads. The best is to favor local agencies like ZeWelcome rather than Airbnb or Booking , because you do not pay service fees and therefore you save between 15% and 20% on the price of your rental 👌 The districts of Gosier, Sainte-Anne , and Saint-François are very popular for their proximity to beaches and amenities. Furthermore, many companies are based in Jarry, which makes Gosier and Petit-Bourg attractive cities for their proximity to the workplace. When we arrived with my girlfriend, we rented a villa for 1 month, just to discover the island and find out better where we wanted to settle. Internet connection: Connectivity is essential for digital nomads. Guadeloupe offers good internet coverage, with fiber optic options in urban areas: Baie-Mahault, Les Abymes, Le Gosier, Le Moule, Sainte-Rose, Le Lamentin, Capesterre-Belle-Eau, Morne à l'Eau , Saint-Claude, Trois-Rivières, Guava, Gourbeyre, Vieux-Fort. In more remote areas, you will have to make do with ADSL but I assure you it works quite well. Transport: Having a car is almost essential in Guadeloupe to explore the island and go to professional meetings. Look on LeBonCoin or turn to professionals. Car rental is a convenient option, with many services available at the airport and in major cities. Luggage and moving: If you plan to settle in for the long term, a viable option may be to bring your car from the mainland. You put all your luggage in it and you rent a container which is transported to Guadeloupe by boat. In summary, settling in Guadeloupe requires a certain amount of organization, but once there, the quality of life and professional opportunities more than compensate for the initial efforts. Networks and Communities for Entrepreneurs in Guadeloupe Guadeloupe offers a dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem, but with a particularity: many circles of entrepreneurs operate privately 😬, which can represent a challenge for newcomers. Here are some concrete ways to integrate into these networks: Private Groups and WhatsApp: Groups like “Entrepreneurs Solidaires”, initiated by Julien Amodeo of Tech in Caraibes ( LinkedIn ), or “Les amis du Spot” created by entrepreneur Jordan Succar ( LinkedIn ) are examples of these private circles. It is essential to actively solicit addition to these groups, often through LinkedIn or other professional contacts. GuadeloupeTech: This association regularly organizes networking events and meetings around digital technology and entrepreneurship. It's a great way to meet other professionals and stay up to date with the latest trends. ZeBox Events: The ZeBox community, with talented organizers like Camille Pourret and Fatoumata Issa-Alzouma ( Camille's LinkedIn , Fatoumata's LinkedIn ), frequently organizes entrepreneurship-related events. These events are golden opportunities to expand your network and gain inspiration from other entrepreneurs. ZeBox Incubator Guadeloupe The ZeBox incubator in Guadeloupe Incubators: Le Village by CA Guadeloupe ( LinkedIn ) and ZeBox, the CMA-CGM incubator ( Website ), are key incubators offering valuable support to startups. Coworking Spaces: In addition to ZeBox, which offers monthly packages for members of its network, other spaces such as Iresa, CoWinner, Le Fort Coworking Social Hub, and Level Up Pli Wô offer suitable and conducive working environments. to networking ( EWAG article ). Integrating into the Guadeloupean entrepreneurial environment requires a proactive approach. It is crucial to be open, actively participate in local events and seek entry into these private groups to successfully integrate. Life in Guadeloupe: An Ideal Working Climate Guadeloupe offers an exceptional living environment that combines work and pleasure. Here are concrete examples for each aspect of life on the island: Tropical Climate: Imagine starting your work day with a view of the Caribbean Sea, a mild and sunny climate all year round. I am writing these words to you from my terrace at Le Gosier, with a light breeze which makes working outdoors pleasant even in the middle of the day 😊 Activities and Leisure: After a productive day, there is nothing like a hike in the Guadeloupe National Park, exploring the tropical forest and discovering hidden waterfalls. For diving enthusiasts, the waters around Pigeon Island offer spectacular dive sites, perfect for unwinding on the weekend. Vibrant Community: Guadeloupean culture is rich and welcoming. I had the opportunity to participate in the Guadeloupe Carnival, a colorful festival that celebrates local culture with music, dance and traditional costumes. It's a great way to immerse yourself in the community and build connections. “Chanté Nwèl” are also a must at Christmas! Accessibility: Guadeloupe is well served by direct flights from Paris, New York, and other major cities, this accessibility facilitates business travel. The Guadeloupe archipelago is surrounded by small islands where time stops for a weekend: Marie-Galante, Les Saintes, La Désirade. It's also incredible to take a getaway to other Caribbean islands , such as Dominica (2 hours by boat), Martinique (4 hours by boat or 30 minutes by plane), or even catamaran cruises to Antigua -Barbuda, or Saint Vincent & The Grenadines 😎 A-detailed-and-accurate-illustrative-map-of-Guadeloupe-and-its-surrounding-islands-closely Safety and Quality of Life: Living in Guadeloupe also means benefiting from a safe environment and quality public services, with developed health infrastructures, and administrative services similar to those offered in mainland France (try to anticipate everything similarly, time passes differently here). In summary, Guadeloupe is not only a place of business opportunities, it is a true paradise for those seeking to combine work and quality of life. My Personal Tips on the Specificities of Guadeloupe Ah, Guadeloupe! A paradise for entrepreneurs, but with its little particularities 😅 👉 Here are my personal tips , with a touch of humor, for navigating this unique world: 1. Waze > Google Maps: Forget Google Maps for your journeys. Here, Waze is king! He knows every shortcut and avoids traffic jams better than a local. 2. Check Business Hours: If Google says a business is open, take it with a grain of salt. Online timetables? More mythical than real. A word of advice: call before you travel. 3. WhatsApp and Insta, the New Kings: SMS, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger? It's from the past. Here, everything happens on WhatsApp or Instagram. Get ready to become a voicemail pro. personal tips and peculiarities of life in Guadeloupe. 4. The Handshake, Key to Business: In Guadeloupe, business is done face to face, with a good handshake. Forget video calls to close a deal, here we rely on human contact. 5. Alternative Services: No Uber, Vinted or Amazon? Do not panic. This is the perfect opportunity to discover local alternatives or even launch your own business in a less saturated market. 👉 Local alternatives to known services: Deliveroo → EasyTaVie / Please Uber → En Woute / Coco Veepee → Island Deal / Foodiles Le Bonbon → Travel Art Caribbean / Kkfèt Blablacar → Karos SeLoger → Domimmo / LeBonCoin Meetup → Instagram Le Bon Coin → The “Gwada Connexion” Facebook group Google → Ask your neighbor, they will probably know more than Google 😅 6. Speak Creole: Learn the expressions above all. It's cool, it shows your interest in local culture and it opens doors. My favorite: “Sé grenn diri ka fé sak diri”, it’s the grain of rice that makes the bag of rice, which could be translated into “small streams make long rivers”. 7. Understand Local History: Visit the ACTe Memorial and pick up a book on the history of Guadeloupe. Understanding Guadeloupe's colonial and cultural past is essential to truly grasp the soul of the island and its people. 8. Import and Adapt Concepts: No need to reinvent the wheel. Many concepts don't exist here yet. Import an idea and adapt it to local specificities. For example, a well-designed manicure booking service could be a hit. 9. Experience the Local Rhythm: Listen to music and explore local dances (hello twerk and bouyon!). 10. Smart Phone Plan: Take a metropolitan plan from Sosh. Plenty of Gigas to work from anywhere, and above all much cheaper than local telephone offers. 11. Join the Gwada Connexion group: If you are looking for the beating heart of the online community in Guadeloupe, look no further than the “Gwada Connexion” Facebook group ( link to group ). It’s a real melting pot of exchanges, information and local tips. Imagine a place where you can find everything: sales announcements, travel advice, lively debates, and even rants or job offers. 12.

      "description": "I spent a month in Tirana in February 2022 and then returned in October for a one-week stay. Generally, I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend Tirana. Here are my Pros and Cons: Pros: - Cheap: Airbnbs are cheap (especially on a monthly basis), food is very cheap (around a third of what you would pay in Germany) and still good quality (most of the time). - Walkable: The city center is pretty compact and everything can be reached on foot - Green: The city center has multiple parks around the main boulevard. The big city park has an artificial lake and paths for runners and cyclists. - Nice People: All locals that I talked to were very nice. I once went to the barber who was the nicest dude ever. We talked for around 1.5 hours about Albania, politics, economics and so on. That way, I learned a lot about the country. - Great coworking cafes: I can recommend the Destil Creative Hub and the Coolab. Nice people, good coffee and a good internet connection. Stay away from the #TECHSPACE, though. Very bad internet, tedious to even get in, not a good experience there. - Safe: I never felt unsafe, even when walking back to my Airbnb at night. There also were a lot of women walking around at night. Also, locals told me that pickpocketing is not a problem in Tirana since there are only few tourists. - Night Life: There are many bars around the city center. Even during the week, there are many people out partying. Cons: - Boring: There is not much to do generally. There are a few museums like the National History Museum, the two Bunk'art museums (old bunkers from communist times) and the House of Leaves. All of them are focused on Albanian History. I can especially recommend Bunk'art 1. It's impressive to wander through this huge bunker. The National History Museum starts strong with a really cool exhibition of relicts and statues from Ancient times on the ground floor. On the top floors, most texts are not translated into English. Also, the exhibitions are partially very old school or trashy (the exhibition about Mother Teresa looks like it was designed by a child in Word 2003). - No digital nomad community: I would have loved to meet more digital nomads, but sadly there is no real community there (yet). - Cars: Traffic is insane in the city. And people drive like crazy. Take care when walking over the road (even at crosswalks). I was almost hit by a car on the crosswalk twice. Also, I was surprised that I made it from the airport to the city and back without an accident, considering the driving style of most drivers. - Coldness: Since it's pretty hot in Albania for most of the year, most buildings don't have heating or well-isolated walls (apartments as well as restaurants, museums etc.). I was there in February and I was constantly cold. So I would recommend visiting Tirana in spring or autumn when it's neither cold nor super hot. In October, the temperature was nice. - Public Toilets: Toilets in public places and restaurants are mostly filthy and unhygienic. Most places don't have urinals, still most men appear to urinate standing up and have terrible aim. That leads to piss being all over the toilet and on the floor. It was like this almost everywhere I went. Generally, I enjoyed my time in Tirana and I definitely plan to visit a third time. I can recommend it to everyone, but especially to people who are on a budget. In spring, you can get a nice Airbnb in the city center for around 500€ - 700€ a month, WizzAir offers cheap flights to Tirana from many major European cities (100€ - 150€ there and back) and food is pretty cheap (main course + drink around 10€ at most restaurants). So I estimate you can visit Tirana for a month at around 1000€ - 1400€ in spring.",

The old outages are referring to the load shedding issue which were routine power outages for the majority of the day. Now power outages are not routine and can last unknown amounts of time, even the main (and only) airport loses power often. Buildings are unheated, water for showering is generally unheated or lukewarm, many houses get their water from urban aquifers which may be heavily polluted, as city water is yellow and oily. Many roads in the city are dirt, and air quality is extremely poor, especially during the crop burning season. Locals are friendly and helpful and many outside of tourist areas may have never met a foreigner before. The locals and the mountains make the place special, everything else about it is quite bad, notably hygiene, food safety, traffic danger, and exposure to all sorts of environmental pollutants. That said, I will be returning to visit the local friends made while there.",

I never felt unsafe during my stay. If you know where to go, there's plenty to do. There are many lovely parks, and the food is delicious and surprisingly affordable (I highly recommend Roxas). The shopping centers are of high quality. It's best to install the Grab app or take taxis for transportation. Public transportation can take a bit longer, but with Grab and taxis, you can get anywhere quickly, and it's reasonably priced. There's a relaxed atmosphere in Davao City. For beaches, it's best to visit Samal Island or spend a few days in Mati (approximately a three-hour drive). You won't encounter many Westerners or nomads here. Tourism is starting to pick up again after the pandemic, but most visitors are from Asia. I highly recommend it and will definitely come back here 100%.",

You can find some low rental places but then you'd be putting yourself in an environment that's not particularly safe. I'd pick a neighbourhood like Kabulonga, Woodlands, Chilenje, Ibex Hill or Makeni. Getting around is easier if you have a car or find a reliable cabby. You can also use the local rideshare app called Ulendo Taxi, it works well and even has female drivers, which I think is great for solo female travellers. Public safety is okay, best not to travel to compounds where safety can be a major issue, especially if you're a muzungu, a local word for 'White person' or someone considered well-off. Expect to be crowded around by street vendors selling everything from phone accessories, clothing, and sometimes local crafts. I wouldn't advise purchasing from these as you'll get ripped off - best go to the weekend markets or the craft village. Zambia doesn't have a café or coffee culture per se but you can find some pretty decent coffee shops that have great coffee and free wifi. Zam Bean Coffee, The Corner Café and 3Tree's are my favs. I'd advise to join the Expat Group's on Facebook for more tips and questions.",

      "description": "I'm Polish and I've been to Gdańsk a number of times over the course of the last 10 years. When I was younger and have seen and experienced less, I was very impressed by the old town. However, these days, after having seen most of Europe and some of the US, I can't help but feel that Gdansk's old town is small and everything that surrounds it has a distinct, post-communist feel, which I do not enjoy. I was there this summer (2022) and it felt like being in an amusement park, with many of the apartment complexes around the old town turning into cheap, short stay aparthotels. The place felt empty due to that. The biggest allure of the city is that it is so close to the sea. Unfortunately, as locals would tell you, it is extremely crowded when the weather is nice, therefore most locals avoid the sea in the summer, which to me sounds weird. Considering the climate, I wouldn't want to be near that sea outside of the summer time! To end this review on a more positive note, I think the city is well connected with the municipal rail making all parts accessible. It is very green outside of the old town and the air quality is the best among largest Polish cities. For foreigners, I think Gdańsk is a must see and as other commenters here noted, it's a good place to nomad from.",

If you have a paddle board or kayak there are plenty of players to pop it in the river or sea.

You will be surprised to see how much the island can offer. I still find new trails and places to discover. However! Sadly the island is changing. First of all, accomidation is getting very expensive and this has changed very quickly. Expect the same price as northern Europe but with much lower living standard. The appartmens here is not build with quality. Also, latley there has been demonstrations towards forginers and digital nomands in particular. I do understand the locals as it is getting to expenstive on the island (even for me as a Scandinavian). I would also like to add that food is a problem here. You will find it hard to find quality and that means both resturantes and supermarkets. An island in a nutshell I suppose.",

Shaped like an airplane, it is the most famous planned town in the world, by legendary architect Oscar Niemayer. Internet is good, you can rent a cheap Airbnb, most of them with a green view, There are more than 800 waterfalls close by (check Chapada dos Veadeiros) and hiking spots. The climate very pleasant as long as you don't go in August/September which is too dry and hot. It's also a cafe paradise, with very good baristas. Its the perfect place to chill if you have to focus on a project while living abroad. It's not big on clubs and nightlife but meet some locals and you will find the best parties at home or crazy places in your life. Rent a car for your stay to have a better experience - or get yourself a bike, cuz it has bike lanes everywhere - and bikes for renting on an app if you wish to. There's a lake with many activities around it, from bars to bike lanes to Hawaiian canoeing, windsurfing, etc. There are many boat rentals around it. There are many recreational parks in town too- check Parque Olhos D'agua. Never ever miss the sunset, the sky is amazing!!! 360 degrees of color explosion. Look up at the trees and you will see tucans and macaws flying among many other types of birds. There are many interesting bars, you just have to do your research. There are many malls with stores that go from Louis Vuitton to the local store, so you will find anything. All the embassies are in Brasilia, so you will find many expats living here. This review is referring to Brasilia only, not the cities around it - which are a bit less safe, so if you go stay at Asa Sul or Asa Norte. Lago Sul and Lago Norte are safe too but there's not much going on there.",

      "description": "Jeju seems gorgeous and cool (very breezy) in the spring, but the nicer the weather, it starts to get overrun with Chinese tourists. The trails along the coast have incredible views of cool islands in the ocean, with crashing waves against rocky cliffs, rolling meadows covered with flowers, and winding tree covered paths, though the trail has so many tourists that it’s very “manicured.” Ask around or just explore and you can find more rustic mountain trails, pass by unexpected mound graves that will make you feel like Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, or climb up wooded trails leading to a surprise temple at the top of a mountain with incredible views of the sunset under the temple eaves. A lot of these places are away from the coast at higher elevations (and much cooler temps), away from where most of the tourists flock. Compared to before, many more Western tourists have shown up, a lot from Western & Northern Europe, as well as from the Middle East and South Asia. Not too many Americans. English not widely spoken by the Koreans here, but depending on your luck, many Koreans try very hard to help. Education rate is extremely high, so many just pull out the Korean version of Google Translate (ChatGPT is much better with Korean than Google Translate), which then makes everything possible. You’ll run into the occasional grumpy old man, though. Incredibly safe at all hours for both men and women. Something I just found out - 119 (Korean 911) is a public service, so if you have a medical emergency, call it, and it’s COMPLETELY FREE, even for non-Koreans with no insurance. But you’ll have to pay for medical services at the hospital if you don’t have traveler’s insurance. Med clinics and hospitals range anywhere in quality from the equivalent of French public clinics to posh Manhattan medical offices. I had an urgent ear problem, lost hearing in my right ear. It turned out to be ear wax I pushed into my ear with a Q-tip, lol. A very kind local pulled out her phone, looked on Korean Google (Naver), found me a highly rated ENT center just 10 minutes away. Gorgeous place, took me right in, and with no insurance I paid $15. I’d never be able to get an ENT appt in the US for weeks, instead would have waited hours at an urgicare center, and would have paid $50-$100 with insurance copayments. AMAZING. My dog swallowed a small bone, a store clerk recommended a vet across the avenue - small but nice and clean facility. With ChatGPT, they did an exam, took X-rays, and gave him medicine, all for $13. Some things here are expensive, but some things, even extremely nice or vital, like some medical services or 119, are incredibly cheap. An EXCELLENT resource is the Jeju Integrated Call Center a nice man just told me about this morning to confirm potential ambulance costs (after my ear problem, I wanted to be prepared for bigger medical emergencies in a foreign country). On a local cell phone, dial 064-120. They have interpreters, and they are a Jeju tourism Association organization for non-Jeju people (Koreans and foreigners) to help us navigate the Jeju system. They will answer questions from where to go for medical services, to tourist attractions, to how to get around the island. They will also connect you to organizations you may be trying to find to get more detailed information. They helped me figure out how to find where I could easily fly to quickly restart the clock on my 90-day time-limited tourist visa. Remember that while Jeju is a “subtropical’ island in Asia, it is not Thailand. With only 50 million people, it is the world’s 12th largest economy and one of the most high-tech countries in the world. It doesn’t make sense to expect prices like in Vietnam or the Philippines, and Koreans expect themselves to speak English about as much as Americans expect themselves to speak Spanish, even though there are exponentially more Spanish speakers in the US than English speakers in Korea. We are digital nomads, meaning we are supposed have a non-American-centric perspective after traveling to so many places. Travel to Japan to find even fewer people speaking English, and even more annoyance that we expect them to, behind their apologetic facade. If you are looking for a cheap place for a temporary workplace, Jeju might not be your best choice, but would you expect anything different from Japan or Barcelona? But compared to Seoul, accommodations are cheaper, and it’s a beautiful place to stay at the right season. I hope this review helps. Jeju isn’t for everyone, but for some, it’s a real gem, and with the few things that I was lucky to find out, I hope these can make the challenges of being somewhere very different smoother so you can focus on the beauty here! Cheers!",

Food OK if you like Mexican and/or tex-mex. Beaches are great and surfing is pretty good, but it gets very crowded in desirable months with lots of parking problems. Housing quality is poor for what you pay; poor insulation/windows, many units don't have A/C and poor heat; but as the climate is changing you need it now. Winters can dip to 39-40 degrees at night and in the A.M. If you stay inland it gets hot. By the coast rarely hot even when you want it in the summer, lots of fog. I would recommend 1-month max in the summer in either Pacific Beach or Downtown area.",

Native cuisine is delicious, maybe the best value restaurants in Europe. 8 months of pleasant weather. Old town is pretty charming. Local fruits are excellent and inexpensive. 1 Euro taxi rides. Georgians are generally warm. English ability among youth is good for FSU. A decent hipster coffee/bar/cafe/coworking scene is emerging from the Ru/Bel/Ukr exile community. The boardwalk on the coast is long and excellent - perfect for running and cycling. Kutaisi airport is only a 24 euro taxi ride away, so lots of cheap connections to central Europe and FSU. Cons: Roads are total chaos, being a pedestrian is scary. International food options and supermarkets are limited. New apartment towers are poorly built, extremely noisy and waiting for the elevator can waste 30 minutes of your day. Businesses seem poorly managed, this results in queues and mistakes. For a nomad who wants to live somewhere for 6 months, on a low cost of living, focus on work and maintain an active lifestyle. Batumi is one of the best options in 2023.",

Here you have the opportunity to taste real genuine, fresh and organic food and experience great wines (such a Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino, Nobile di Montepulciano, Bolgheri Sassicaia, Ornellaia and much more) ! Think that Italy is the only country in the world where each region produce a different kind of wine with different kind of local grapes. It is a real bless for palate. Italians are friendly and locals even more. Almost everybody speaks English here. I am a women and I consider the place to be a Women safe place. Moreover, Firenze and Tuscany are LGBTQ+ friendly: just remember that the first worldwide riot aimed to fight in favor of the Gay Community happened in Florence almost 500 years ago with the Medici's! As most part of Europe, Winter is cool and windy but Spring, Summer and Fall are the best period ever! During the Pandemic, the Tuscan hospitals have demostrated to be over the top of their expectations to face both the emergency and the daily care. In Italy, health care at hospital is FREE for everybody, foreigners included. Just to recap: food and wine are simply amazing and born to satisfy all palates in particular also veggie and vegan, art and nature are all around you, the region is really safe, nightlife is cool, so I think it is high time to pack your bags! I really recommend it. Just Enjoy Firenze which is also a great place for a workaction away from your home and your office! Moreover, traveling with your pet is easy as they are very welcomed almost all over and vets are fab!",

I tried keeping my budget similar to those in Bangkok and that was my biggest mistake of my stay here.

Hospitals: How can hospitals be pretty bad if Germany has one of the best medical systems in the world? This judgments compares it with remote 3rd world cities which is by definition not logical. Germany, and therefore also Cologne, has most likely the best emergency system in the world (ambulance must arrive within max. 12 minutes - independent of traffic) and no one will ask \"who pays\" when you have a serious illness/accident. Doctors have a high education as well (you have to be part of the top 5% of high school to enter a medical study). Cold in winter: Well, it is not a tropical country. However, snow is rarely. Temperature during days drops below zero on maximum 20 days a year. Surely it is not the most sunny place on earth, but \"very cold\" is definitely elsewhere. Friends: Cologne is the city of carnival. From November to February you will find parties every day and meet people. Surely, friends are made elsewhere, but at least you will not be alone drinking your Kölsch at the bar. \"Bar talks\" with strangers are common. Share your number and see what happens. Besides this, Cologne has a tradition of clubs (football club, tennis club, carnival club...). If you want to find friends, you must integrate and do such things as well. Then you find plenty of cool people. Just break the ice.",

Local Mexicans come for long weekends since the drive is now tolerable, which is packing the town. It feels like the majority of foreigners I meet either want to start a business or own real estate here. I never made it to Bali, but from the conversations I’ve had for other DN, this is like Bali right before post-pandemic. It’s strange - everyone you chat with knows this area is heading for Tulum, yet too many people just have dollar signs in their eyes - or in this case Mexican Pesos.

They have recently released the Premium Visa for digital nomads that allows to live on the island for at least 1 year (renewable). Best places to live in are the North (very well developed with all facilities and business centres) and the West of the island (more for those who prefer to surf the waves and hike the mountains in between 2 video calls !). The Mauritians are very welcoming and smiling people. I am not the first one to be touched deeply by their generosity. Food is very nice, people are helping, music and culture are the best. Wind in the South is perfect for kite surfing, wind foil, windsurf, etc There are also new coworking spaces opening all around the island and you can hop from The Hive coworking spaces to a nice South African café such as Bloom in the North or to a tea place/colonial house such as Les Aubineaux in the centre of the island. All with nice wifi and great vibes. My personal recommendations : visit the tea factory of Bois Cheri, taste the Vanilla Rum of Saint-Aubin, hop in the beautiful lagoon of Pointe d'Esny, and hike Le Morne at sunrise. I cherish every single one of these visits. I would also recommend to be accompanied by an agency to get your visa, find a trusted real estate agency, choose your local insurance, etc. I asked Smart Traveller, they are specialised in helping digital nomads come settle in Mauritius and they were the best. Young and friendly team, professional and human. Cannot recommend them enough actually. Still a great adventure to be here in Mauritius working remotely and a dream come true for my family and I.",

Food is horrible, with no real healthy options to eat outside. Very limited and low quality products supermarket. Almost all restaurants have typical ski resort offers for all the British you will find here. Yes, tons of them come for vacations and the resort gets so crowded that even in the best days only a couple of hours have good enough conditions. And that’s if you can make it in the first hours. Even the “fast line” gets packed with tourists with “vip tickets” bought from some hotels and agencies. Long waiting hours await you not only in the gondola but almost every lift. People are unfriendly, service is bad. You’re supposed to pay for a coworking to be involved in any social event. The “coworking Bansko” cult led by its weird founder is specially known for being extra exclusive and unfriendly with people outside of the coworking space. The gyms are small and only one has good enough quality. It’s cheap, but it gets crowded easily due to its small size and limited capabilities. You won’t be able to workout properly if you want to do advance stuff. Bansko’s overall price of living compared to its value it’s very high, not only because prices are not as cheap as you could imagine but because quality is terribly low. In my whole life of travelling I haven’t found a place where the standards for everything are so low.",

Climate is simply amazing (I swam in the ocean at Christmas time, water was 21 degrees). Great for walking in nature, diving, canyoning, active people will never get bored. Cost of living is very affordable, although I agree rents are going up and real estate prices definitely on the up too due to an increased interest from Europeans and North Americans. Food is all local and fresh, including great fish and seafood. Restaurants are plentiful and affordable. Even top restaurants like Akua will only set you back around 50 euros a head for a top meal including wine. There is a large and friendly international community that organisers many events for all tastes. Some of the people below seem really disgruntled.

Seminyak is not 'Balifornia' (Canguu), some will like it for that reason alone. Traffic can get clogged in Seminyak but it's still far better than Canggu. Seminyak is just as commercialized as Canggu, but in a different way. If you're familiar with NY, Canggu has east village or lower east side vibes, while Seminyak is more soho. Of course neither comes close to the actual NY neighborhoods. You could say Seminyak is more polished with better infrastructure, so you'll find more sidewalks and high end artisan shops, while Canggu is like a super westernized village. Both areas are full of tourists, expats, and nomads, so you'll find plenty of good co working spaces, vegan cafes, and good coffee in Seminyak. If you're trying to avoid mosquitos (and the gekkos they bring), there are definitely less in some parts of Seminyak, due to the infrastructure being more built up, although you still need to use repellent. Be alert to Seminyak scammers, they will spot you from a mile if you're western. Thankfully my NY skills made it easy to avoid and/or get rid of them. Seminyak has some of the best beachfront bars and cafes, with pools overlooking the sea, better than what you find in Canggu. Don't get me wrong, I still love Canggu, just not thrilled with what it's become, and Seminyak provides an escape that's just a grab or scooter ride away. If you decide to check out Seminyak you need to dig to find the gems. Because on the surface it's pretty typical, but once you discover some of the amazing places there, you can create your own hideaway. It took me a few days and many hours of research, by foot and online, to find the best hidden places of Seminyak. Prices are better than Canggu but again, you need to dig a bit.",

There's amazing food (Asian, Western and fusion). You'll be surrounded by entrepreneurs, artists, fashion designers and models. Many of whom do speak English. It gets better if you speak basic Mandarin though. You don't need to care about the characters. Just learn to speak, that's important enough. The nice thing about Mandarin is China is so big everyone has an accent, so for Chinese it really doesn't matter so much that you have one too. Depending on how and what kind of money you make, your experience also changes. Like most places in Asia, English teachers are the lowest rank in the hierarchy of foreigners here. Chinese know. But if you're an entrepreneur, even (or especially) an online one, that's high regarded. The problem with working online here is obviously the firewall which can make it very difficult. I've heard good stories about Shadowsocks which seems to work better than regular VPNs. The recent China vs. America tensions are in fact making people slightly more hostile against Western foreigners. But remember this is Shanghai, it's a metropolitan city, they're usually much less xenophobic than out in the country. Mostly Shanghainese are happy to embrace foreigners, become friends with them, as long as they speak Chinese. And as long as you invest a lot of time. Just popping in and out like a nomad isn't necessarily going to work so well with Chinese. Relationships are long-term.",

It’s a shame because there are some really nice buildings and neighborhoods that would be lovely if there was some care put into them. Unfortunately, it’s all dirty and run down. Almost every night, you will hear fireworks go off at all hours, especially if you are near any of the parks. It’s maddening! I’m aware that Manchester is the “working class/historically industrial” city of the UK, just sad that not a lot of effort has been put into it. We didn’t feel comfortable being out at night as there were several dodgy people out loitering the bus stops and yelling at random people. I will state though that they are doing some renovations and new construction in some areas, so perhaps in about 10 years it might get better, especially if more Londoners move up here.

Being smaller it helps you stay focused, spend less time travelling around etc. I personally have never felt unsafe there and pretty much all the nomads I meet there say the same. Power is much more stable than 7 years ago, for me it's never really been an issue. Interenet to the island is usually 300-400mbps up/down for anywhere with a good router/wifi.

Tiny place that revolves around surfing and skateboarding (fishing isn't as prevalent as I was expecting and much less compared to Essaouira). It's also not as 'sleepy' as everyone describes and not as cheap. Everyone knows each other and it's easy to dig into berber culture. Start with the taxi rank manager and ask about pretty much anything. Moroccan's love to help. You'll be sold weed every 10 meters, make of that what you will. Best things to do here are eat, surf and relax. Seems like a lot of construction and investment is going into this place so catch it while it's 'quiet'. I'd avoid staying on the main street as it's loud pretty much all the time with dogs barking, cats fighting, etc. I found Booking (website) to be the cheapest accommodation but nothing beats landing and getting stuck in to find a place for even cheaper. There is no bank machine in Taghazout. One in the Radisson nearby (when it works) and the next closest is Tamraght (I found one that doesn't charge). Sunny and chill. Fun if you like surfing and relaxing on the beach.",

The city has so many conveinces and is very walkable - it’s perfect for someone looking to work and enjoy themselves. Internet has been stable and fast. I get it’s not authentic, but it’s a great place to take breather and just relax",

Probably the most developed major city in Latin America with the strongest technology infrastructure which makes it very appealing for digital nomads. Also a lot of international business coming through here so there can definitely be good networking opportunities. It’s also super safe compared to other South American hotspots like Medellin however it is significantly more expensive. I would say prices here are slightly less expensive than southern small-towns in the rural United States The crowd does feel a bit more touristy than I would personally like but there are interesting people that you will meet here who are primarily from Europe. The local seafood is good and there are a lot of great international options all over town. Nightlife is strong on the weekends and if you’re specifically looking for that, I would recommend staying at the Selina in Casco Viejo since they have a rooftop sky bar and an underground club which are the most popular spots in town and are tough to enter if you’re not a Selina guest. I do agree with the last comment that this city does seem like it can get boring fast if you’re staying for an extended vacation but if you’re spending most of your days living a normal daily life of work, self-care, exercise, basic social life, this is not a bad place to do it.",

      "description": "I just came back after 12 years, last time I lived in SF for 3 months in 2012. Back then it was a walkable and clean and fun, pretty safe city. The only place back then that you'd avoid was the Tenderloin. There was homeless but they actually weren't aggressive. There wasn't much robberies either. San Francisco in 2024 is very different, as you've probably seen from social media. The homeless problem has grown a lot since then, and they're not just clustered in the Tenderloin, they're all over the city doing Fentanyl and the famous \"leaning over\" when they are high. Robberies since COVID has exponentially grown. There's robberies on stores like Apple and Nike and I could see a 24/7 police presence now outside their stores with police inside the store even. If you park your car in SF, you will get the window smashed and the stuff taken out of. Criminals have radio sensors to detect any Bluetooth/WiFi signals to see if your car has valuables. SF recommends keeping the car windows open so criminals can easily get in without smashing your window. The fact that that's official policy, is just insane. I have to admit, you walk parts of SF, like the residential parts of Mission away from the main streets, and San Francisco is beautiful like it was in 2012. Beautiful trees, flowers, plants on the sidewalks, beautiful cute colored houses. But why even be here when the most people important in tech having left San Francisco now? - VCs are in Sand Hill Road, not SF - Elon Musk just moved X/Twitter to Texas - Stripe left San Francisco because of the crazy tax on every single payment - Startup founders can now fly in to raise money, then work remotely from anywhere else There is a really burgeoning AI founder scene in SF right now. But most of them are just inside their homes or offices and hardcore coding all day. So what's the point of being in SF? There's smart tech people yes but the really successful ones live South of SF in Silicon Valley where it's safer. San Francisco is a beautiful city lost to bad policy. Maybe it'll make a comeback at some point. But not in 2024.",

Bulgaria is the poorest country in Europe, with very high rates of smoking - people can smoke inside restaurants with impunity here. Quality of life seems generally low. However, the food is delicious! :) The expat community, even for a relatively large city such as Plovdiv, is a fraction the size of a relatively small city like e.g. Paphos, Cyprus. In Paphos there's all kinds of activities organised for any day of the week. In Plovdiv, even in peak season, it seems quiet, with little to do. We didn't have high expectations for Bulgaria, but we were curious and wanted to explore. Bulgaria was below our expectations, and sadly we plan never to return. We can't think of any reason to recommend Bulgaria above one of the many better choices out there such as Prague, Krakow, Budapest, Paphos, most other European cities.",

      "description": "Izmir is off-the-radar of many tourists and nomads, but it has a lot to offer. It's relatively affordable, and it's warmer in the winter than many other parts of Türkiye, it has good public transit, decent food and shopping options, and reliably fast and stable internet. It's also a good jumping-off point for a day trip to Çeşme and several Greek islands that can be reached by ferry. You can pay by card nearly everywhere except the Izmir Metro, Izban — even for small purchases of 50¢ (currently 16TL) Things that might turn you off: 1. This is not an English speaking city, even among the young university population. You can get by, but you are unlikely to strike up intricate conversations with most locals unless you're attending a language exchange meetup or hanging out near an English school. If however, you are looking for language immersion, I can recommend a homestay and/or making friends with locals here. 2. Turkish people love to smoke. If you want to hang out at a cafe and work, particularly outside most people are lighting up. 3. Internet in Türkiye is censored. Even sites like Booking aren't available without a VPN. The big ones that the government knows about may also be blocked. On the same note, connecting to public wifi requires personal information including your passport, and to be able to receive SMS 2FA, so if your foreign SIM does not have service, you can't use these APs. 4. Pork is really only available at the upmarket Macrocenter supermarket. Every restaurant offers halal as a default, and their version of pepperoni or sausage is all beef based. Beer and liquor, however, are available in every corner store and supermarket. I don't know why. If you do decide to buy a Turkish SIM, only Tourist plans are available to foreigners without residency, with an inflated price of $21 just for the SIM and activation. (Though the data packages can be competitive.) Therefore, for short visits, it might be more economical to use one of these world roaming eSIMS, which I don't normally recommend. I wouldn't recommend using the expat FB groups to find short or long-term housing because they are cryptic and never list the price in the ad. Though maybe you'll ask around and find one by word-of-mouth instead and get a better deal, more in line with Turkish incomes. Lastly, do try to integrate in your local community and chat up locals. Don't be the digital nomad that doesn't talk to anyone. You can live anywhere. This doesn't mean that you need to behave like the place you left behind.",

The city is great for business, also really stylish apartments, there's a parallel high society living in a bubble there and if you're part of it, live is way superior to what you would know from home. Sadly poorer Guatemalans are a little depressed and introverted and the upper class wont talk to foreigners unless you are there for a longer term and do something important. Women in general are friendly there, very conservative and girl-friend material. Depending on the zone, this will vary a lot, like everything in Guatemala.

Everywhere is pretty much the rubbish bin for many locals. Infrastructures are not well maintained. Definitely not a picturesque city except for the trees planted in city centres. The \"parks\" here are more like green pockets surrounded by heavy traffics. Not quite functioning as a park where you can chill. It's a fairly safe city but nothing is particularly interesting. Most working spaces free from air pollution would be in shopping malls. But they're currently having many restrictions to get in (as of 9/4/2021). Houses here are not designed to bear the humid tropical heat and are heavily reliant on AC. Healthy foods are expensive therefore not accessible to everyone even though it is a basic human right. The overall quality of life I'd rate 5/10.",

      "description": "I mostly agree to another negative feedback, although I don't think it's really 1/10 city, but overall, yes, it's also one of most unlikable cities I've been nomading to (and I've been to basically all countries of Europe as of now). I guess \"enchanting atmosphere\", as one of reviewers said is represented in a way of heaps of garbage everywhere, groups of sketchy immigrant people right on the main walking street (I've been asked for money two times already there by beggars) and I really lol'd at notion of \"it felt extremely safe\" in another review - I'm a tall man, and still I don't feel comfortable walking around a city in evenings apart from the main streets, gave me really \"i'm-not-feeling-that-safe-here\" vibes. And the best quality grocery shop in all center is this Lidl sh*thole? I can't even buy quality food... And also yes, basically all the people here just don't speak English. And I can't deny - there are quite beautiful places in Palermo, nice squares and there are cozy streets, and beautiful churches, there are definitely places to see and visit, but nevertheless... For example Trapani felt more safe and less dirty (even still quite dirty tho).",

      "description": "Liverpool is not a great place to live as a nomad. It is a perfect tourist / nightlife city; evident at the weekend where hordes of locals and partygoers from the surrounding areas descend on the city centre (bachelor and bachelorettes included). It has probably the best nightlife in the UK, due to the fact the city centre has perfect walkability and the local government has ensured there are ideal pockets of bars and clubs placed optimally around town. A Londoner born and raised, I lived there for 5 years, leaving in June 2023 having become a nomad in February that year. Once becoming a nomad, all of the glaring issues arose which are important for a good nomad lifestyle which make it unsuitable to live in once adopting this lifestyle. 1. Nomadlist is accurate that it is very difficult to make friends here. There is a dominant university core of students who have a hostile attitude toward 'outsiders' (i.e. locals). This wouldnt be an issue in and of itself, but due to the city not having a sufficient young professional workforce (techy or otherwise) there arent many people in the city who you will have much in common with. Coupled with the fact that Scousers (Native Liverpool residents) are superficially friendly (they may be great to you on a night out, but they will never truly be your friend) it means the city has very jarring socio-demographics. 2. It is getting more expensive; with more and more Londoners realising the north is more cost effective, rent costs and general costs of everything has increased dramatically due to this. This is happening across the country in 2023-24, but due to the city actually declining somewhat, (ill get to that) there is no real justification for these cost increases (especially housing) 3. The weather is pretty terrible most of the year. In summer you may get a week of decent weather (and there is nowhere better to be than by the River Mersey on a hot day), but it can be very depressing, especially during winter. 4. The city government is not investing in city matters that will improve the city; they seem to only want to invest in matters relating to nightlife, and appeasing the local population who aren't particularly forward thinking. For example, there doesnt seem to be any new business's moving to the city, therefore any young professionals graduating from one of the five universities here, dont have any incentive to stay, live and invest in the city. As of 2023, my negative points point to the fact that the city is now on another decline; it shouldnt be shortlisted as a nomad destination",

      "description": "Some feedback how Kuching looks like from my perspective these days (because I guess city vibe changed a lot since covid): Place has a lot of potential but as of right now (mid-2023) it is just OKAY but kind of boring for staying longer than 1 month and having a base here for solo nomads. I was ready to bail after 2 weeks but committed for 1 month anyway 1. SOCIAL/COMMUNITY This was the biggest drawback for me. - There is no any community right now (or is dead by now), I'm not talking only about DN community but also there is no any FB Hiking Group, Board games group, Couchsurfing group etc. - Get ready you won't meet ANY nomads within 1 month even if really trying hard and asking on different FB groups, Slacks etc. - There is barely any couchsurfing travelers. Most people come here for 3-7 days, most of them are couples. Couchsurfing hangout is dead - met only one local girl and she told these days maybe 2 people a month wanna hangout - If you travelling solo you will get bored after 2 weeks. - there are some expats but mostly those are 50/60+ years old retired people and all expats even those younger mostly only active in their inner circles - found it hard to make any friends with locals. Even when starting conversation yourself feels like pulling teeth... - dating apps (tinder/bumble) also not helpful to get someone to have a coffee or lunch - looks like everybody has long covid, depressed or lazy to get out of home and do anything during weekends 2. COWORKINGS There are 2 good coworkings (as a space): thegrounds and icube but: Shared CONS: - both are mostly empty (most of the time only 1-2 locals in open space, other locals in private offices -> you won't have much interaction with them) - both open only from 8.00-18.00 and closed during weekends. - zero initiative - no any members lunch or trying to make community alive ==Icube - has WIFI speed only around 10MB/10MB (seems limited per user) - only allow to login to WIFI with one device - it's more far away from oldtown (but no problem if you have motorbike) - hot desk are big NO NO - those are tiny circular desk and plastic chairs that are only OK to have a tea and chitchat - cold desks are good but they have only 13 sits for those - most are rented by locals/companies but not used for 90% of days in a week -> I was only one nomad, place looked empty but still it was the last cold desk I could rent. During my 2 weeks on average there was 1-3 other people in open space + on the good side cold desk is very cheap and the price per week is pretty much the same -> don't need to commit for 1 month. But I don't like fixed desk -> harder to get to know someone if cowork is mostly empty + downstairs lots of shops for having a lunch + having more startup vibe look ==The Grounds - freaking cold air-con (had to go with long pants and shoes instead of shorts + flip-flops and still felt cold) + pretty much inside downtown - don't need transport if living nearby + more modern look than icube + have 5 days flexible pass 2. INTERNET I would say overall mobile internet is slow in Kuching. I tried both Digi and Yoodo (by Celcom). Even though speed test was showing 10MB/10MB often everything was very sluggish even when signal was strong (just simple website browsing, restaurant images in google maps, etc.) 3. ACTIVITIES/NATURE - closest beach is ~40min away on motorbike (too far away to randomly each day go to see sunset and it's raining most of the evenings anyway), all beaches are very 'meh' (I though Penang or even Langkawi beach is meh but Kuching was even lower league). Probably not safe to swim (they have warning sign about \"watch out crocodiles\") - even if you busy most of the week you can tick off most places worth to visit within 2 weekends - nothing spectacular, sure there is wildlife center to see orangutans (if you lucky) but that's event only for like 2h - national parks are ok but e.g. bako national park has only 2 routes open (those more interesting are closed) - borneo culture museum or sarawak culture center was ok but nothing mind blowing (and not cheap) + the only thing that I liked is waterfront area during evening, musical fountain and vibe around there. Now go search instagram for hashtag #Kuching or #sarawak for inspiration -> probably you won't find many interesting spots that are \"must see\" 4. WEATHER - at least in whole May was raining a lot! pretty much every day mostly after 17.00 though. Raining is not like raining in thailand or indonesia that after 15-30min it stops and after another 30min everything is dry. When it's raining it will be raining probably for 1-2h minimum. This makes evenings more boring and need to force yourself to get out especially if you are on motorbike 5. COSTS - not easy to find some decent accomodation on AirBnB for $1000 or less. I stayed in Kozi Square (many airbnbs there) for ~$550. Room was ok but tiny but a little better than most average hotels. I recommend to just rent Hotels weekly around waterfront instead - motorbike for 1 month is around 600 RM but that's semi-automatic, if you want automatic it's 800 RM. Can drive only around Kuching. The semi automatic was very good though (waterproof phone holder, and waterproof storage in the back) + lots of hotel choices for around 20-30$ in downtown so don't have to commit for 1 month As a rule of thumb cost of living is similar to Penang (though in Kuching accommodation rental cheaper) and around 2-3x of cost in Chiang Mai 6. TIPS a) don't commit for 1 month upfront, better just commit for 2 weeks, see how much you like it or if you click with someone and then decide if worth to stay longer or go to e.g. Sabah instead b) choose accommodation in walking distance to waterfront (oldtown/chinatown). This is where city is most alive in the evening and even if you are 5min away on motorbike like me was, it's still better to be there because often raining and easier to meet some random travelers randomly walking c) this is not Thailand. Many places closes at 15.00 or 17.00. Other only opens at 17.00 but stay open until 22.00. Most places outside of waterfront area will be closed very early (before 18.00). Even most food places around iCube cowork closes before 18.00. The good things is that easier to find place open for breakfast. d) you will probably have better experience if not traveling solo but with partner or travel-mate and co-living (can share nicer flat and car, feeling less boring) e) consider first 2 days staying maybe in some nicer social hostel - at least you can maybe meet some travelers and do something together. Or even maybe renting better single room in some nicer hostel if you are solo nomad (even if it's less comfortable than having own studio/condo) f) many AirBnB places have not good WIFI (because using mobile internet instead of wired) - double check it before renting since remember coworking spaces are only open between 8.00-18.00 and closed during weekends.",

      "description": "Many people get the wrong idea about this city because they don't know where to go or stay at a touristy place. It's one of the best cities for me personally to live in (decided to move here full-time). If you still want to live in a city with it's amenities, but want to have the ability to run to nature within 10-20 minutes, this might be it for you. Yes, it's not cheap, and I would put Limassol into the exact cost of living brackets as Lisbon or Berlin. For long-term living, the costs are much lower because of lower local taxes (12.5% for freelancers and companies), while Germany has a 45% tax an example. Another main con is public transportation, hence you need to rent a car to experience the real Cyprus. Pros: - Perfect for work/life balance (for me) - Beaches are in and around the city, you live in the middle of the island, so Troodos mountains, white sandy beaches of Ayia Napa, other cities (Paphos, Larnaca) are just a 1h drive away. - Rapidly growing and improving. A completely different experience from 5/10 years ago. Lots of great coffee shops to work from and improving internet connection (most coffee shops have good enough internet). - Some of the friendliest locals I've seen. On and they all speak English - The weather is great 95% of the time. August is too hot for most people and January/February can be too cold or rainy (15-20 C) compared to alternatives such as Asia - Nightlife improved drastically in the last few years with cool bars, nightclubs, tech/house or techno music, day parties, restaurants that have djs playing chill music and so on. - Very safe - Cyprus has this charming \"villagy\" vibe that Greece and other southern countries have, so don't expect to find Bangkok here:) Cons: - Getting more expensive here (Berlin level). Other cities in Cyprus are much cheaper. If you live here as a resident tax savings cover for it. - Lack of public transportation. You need to rent a car to get around the places (Limassol is a very \"long\" city, so going from one point to another might take awhile). - Limassol still has some abandoned or not clean buildings that you could find in other Middle Eastern countries, but don't let that fool you. - This is not a con to me (even though I don't speak Russian/Ukranian/Belarussian): There is quite a community of Belarussians, Russians and Ukrainians fleeing the war, but most of the ones I met are super friendly and very nice. If you really don't like hearing Slavic languages, most of the nice bars and restaurants have mainly locals, Greeks or Europeans. Almost all of them are very friendly and come from amazing cities like Kiev.",

There is very little to do here, no great cultural sights, no great venues to attend.

I love the farmers markets and feel very spoiled to have access to so many locales from which to buy organic food (and vegan, paleo, etc.). What I don't love is the racism in the public schools. Madison is a fairly segregated city, which has been a huge disappointment. Over the past three years or so, road rage has become a significant problem and the crime rate has drastically increased. There has been a large influx of people moving to Madison, which has resulted in traffic challenges. I loved Madison when I first moved here, but it is becoming increasingly dangerous and the housing market is definitely overpriced.",

Don't get me wrong, it's lovely and exotic, and people are warm and welcoming, but it can get pretty boring after 30 days. Cost of living is NOT cheap. Groceries are much more expensive than in any other places we've travelled to in the last two years. Restaurants are all the same price (around 30€ for 2 people) and pretty much serve the same thing. Food variety is not great. If you come here for surfing, the waves are inconsistent at best and, at worst, non-existent. On paper, it seems like a nice idea. In reality, it feels like locals and the government hired good marketers to sell the destination to digital nomads. On the bright side, we had stable internet and it was sunny EVERY day. It's always windy in Santa Maria, so you don't need AC. Most people speak perfect English or understand at least.",

Especially when landlords tend to increase rental prices once they learn you're a good tenant. Locals may appear friendly, but the reality often differs.

We were recommended the place as an upcoming nomad place but it just doesnt work for nomads at all. Internet is plain terrible. Even in the coworking (NomadGao, Clay etc) and a back up sim, you cant make calls reliably to save your life. Next to no community there, but strong hippie and party crowd there. The streets are very stressful and you have to be comfortable driving a scooter in hectic streets in bad conditions. The police will stop you daily if you look like a tourist to shake you down for money, driving license or helmet. The value for money was the worst I ever saw. Accommodation was a real pain as no place would divert much at all from their daily rate, even with local friends making the negotiations for us. After a frustrating weel long search, we ended up spending 940$ for a month in a loud apartment by the street (lots of honking) just because the bathroom didnt reek. Overall, if you are considering working from Goa. Just don't.",

On the plus side, everything is very accessible and of course loads of high quality Thai food everywhere, mixed in with a bunch of expat options. Found the western-style markets and prices in general to be considerably more (in relative terms) than Bangkok. I imagine this is due to the large expat community here. Having said that, Covid has decimated the place and many expats have left. As an example, it’s Friday evening here right now (July ‘22) and both Tamarind and Cicada markets are virtually empty. On the down side, at least for me, there’s really not that much to do here. Particularly if you want to be somewhere where there are great beaches, at least by Australian, Caribbean or Southern Thailand standards, then think again. If you are ok with brown sand and no surf to speak of then you’ll probably like it.",

      "description": "Did the previous reviewer say world class art and culture? Where would this be because after 2 years there, I was craving art and culture. Like, my experience is the polar opposite so unless art includes street statues that happen a month of each year and if by culture meaning you run into a single black guy on the street, I don't get it. It's really white, very few Hispanics, almost no blacks and few Asians. No museums (outside of historical ones). Most of the Mormons live in Provo if that matters. There weren't really any sketchy areas I've encountered in SLC. SLC is a good city to visit especially if you're skiing. If you're not skiing, I don't know what else you can do. I found the city to be quite boring. The national parks in eastern and southern UT are gorgeous but we're talking 4-8 hour drive away. Skiing is great. I personally like Park City but it's boring there too. Dating sucks all around. Between recovering Mormons to Mormons, there aren't a lot in between even if the city attracts non-mormons to work there. And if you're not white, it'll be a struggle in the dating scene. SLC nightlife is dominated mainly by college kids. There's only 3 places that I'd consider hanging at as a 30's and up nomad and they're not very close to each other. It's a walkable city although things are a bit spread apart. The new SLC airport did not consider those who fly on airlines other than Delta. It's a 20 minute walk to get from check in to the furthest gate in terminal B. Imagine old folks and handicap. Crazy.",

      "description": "Having travelled and lived around Thailand and Malaysia, Malacca feels somewhat disjointed without any real centre apart from the touristy Jonker Street. Weather (January 2024) ranges between a balmy & breezy 28C to a slightly uncomfortable and sticky 33C. Local food is very reasonably priced (3.50 Ringett for sweet tea or kopi, 7 Ringett for a plate of noodles), if you avoid the most touristy places and stick to local side alleys and restaurants where the local people eat. People here are very friendly and interested to know where you come from, many speak good English. Big Chinese and Nyonya community here, which reflects in the food, along with Portuguese & Malay influences. Some of the longer-stay hotels are cheaper when rented through private landlords (find them on Booking website). Buying a traditional wooden house in the centre of Malacca near the canal costs from 12,000 Ringett (prices as of Jan 2024).",

Not the MOST exciting city in the world, but certainly a lovely place to stay and take it easy for a couple days or weeks and get some work done. My favorite part of the city was the canals that run through certain parts, they were really pretty and added a lot of character and there were oftentimes bars/restaurants along the water or trails for running/walking/biking. There are a lot of good restaurants and bars, the people were all very friendly, and we had fun going to an area of town called Digbeth one night - it's a very hip area with a lot of bars and of cool graffiti. Not a ton of sights to see, and of course you can expect typical UK prices, but a very nice place never-the-less! I'd recommend staying either somewhere near the canals on the western side of the city, or right in the city center.",

Still has the comforts of a city with a big SM mall and good shops and restaurants. Absolutely packed in summer as it's a popular vacation destination for locals. Getting around can be difficult because only taxis are allowed, not ride-sharing, and the taxis are in high demand. Grab app only shows taxis and often fails to secure a ride. That said, the city is compact and traffic does flow well, probably because of the ride-share restriction! For mobile internet, I found PLDT Smart works well. Globe rarely works at all.",

If I could go back in time, I never would have gone as I developed chronic fatigue syndrome for 4.5 years starting during this trip, due to overvaccinating (several tropical diseases injected into me in a short time), the Malarone effects, poor diet, stress, etc. I stopped by Doula for a one night stay both when I arrived and when I left. Do not give men at the airport money. Don't let anyone handle your suitcases. Guys came out wearing (fake) uniforms, then repeatedly demanded money from me. I eventually told them in French to \"leave me alone,\" which worked, but the cab drivers took my luggage even though I told them I was waiting for the hotel to pick me up (hotels should do this, I used Ibis and it was very clean and comfortable, with hot water). The woman working at Ibis told me not to go outside at all, even during the day. (I was traveling alone.) An activist I met in Kumbo said they knew someone who was robbed at knife point at 11 a.m. in Doula. I had black stuff coming out of my nose after the bus ride through town from the pollution being so bad. The airport demanded more money when I returned, and I honestly couldn't tell if it was legit, the guy kept insisting and they even had a booth. Living in Kumbo, I was one of only about 10 white people I saw the entire time I was in Cameroon. It took three days to travel between there and Doula. I felt much more comfortable in the small town, but was often lectured by older men about not greeting properly (once said \"hey\" to my friend and he berated me for being so casual until I started crying). I had stomach spasms from eating and developed a rash from the dirty water (though there are clean water sources, I just chose to use the shower instead of a bucket). I spoke French in Doula and English in the Northwest region, I'm not sure if many people speak English in Doula or not. I met people who'd gotten malaria while staying in Cameroon, and people waited to take malaria pills till after they got sick, since it's the same pill (which is what I'd do in hindsight). Overall, it was the most culture shock I've ever had and a very challenging experience. As far as I know, people only traveled there to help social causes like I was (the Peacecorps has a presence), not for tourism. I'm not sure how it is now, but in 2009, I had to go to a (pretty slow) internet cafe, didn't have internet at home (though I believe they had it in the Doula Ibis hotel), and there were days-long electricity outages. So I don't know that it would make sense for a digital nomad long term.",

You'll see people wear lots of hemp and earth toned clothing and dreadlocks all over the place. Which is kinda fun for a change. The same people you'd see in Ubud or Koh Pha Ngan or Goa, you'll see in Graz. Speaking of the people, they're nice, but they won't smile at you in public mostly. I also wouldn't say it's easy to meet people here, but that's probably Austrian culture. Everyone already got their cliques. Oh one annoying thing, eveeeeeryone smokes here or that's how it feels like. You won't be able to sit anywhere outside without getting smoke in your face. In terms of activities, you can do quite a lot of hiking/walking around Graz in the hills and mountains. It's really beautiful if you just walk half an hour north east which we did. A nice place to work is Martin Auer, they have a few diff spots around town, really AMAZING coffee and baguette sandwhiches there, you won't believe how good. Also the Kunsthaus Graz has a great cafe with amazing food. So TL;DR Graz is a nice little cosy town, fun to stop by for a few days.",

Government entities have their sh*t straight more than many other nations. Average internet. Stable power grid. Cons: dangerous near Virunga unless you go on a guided tour, water is unpotable and unsafe from the tap unless boiled even in Kigali, locals stare at you without interruption (not in a frightening way but it's uncomfortable), dangerous to navigate the traffic unless you're used to complete road chaos, slow/poor service in restaurants, everyone asks you for money even the children in rural villages where tourists don’t go, need a car/motorcycle to do anything (not a walkable city), very poor selection of anything in terms of shopping needs and expensive.

      "description": "Its mediocre, generic town in a bottom 4 state in flyover country. The town is at about 71K and its boring, the music scene is almost nonexistent, and the genre is usually country/twang southern rock. There is SkyPAC and Capitol arts, but they are mostly centered around the Boomer demographic and needs. Very conservative politically and socially. Churches everywhere, bible study groups and people trying to convert you if they see you are a non-believer or of a different faith. Lots of smokers and sus looking people. Lots of jobs, but almost no careers, think service sector. The town is run by the same wealthy white boomers since the 70s. And it's still corrupted like it was in the good old days. Homes are becoming overpriced. Almost all the new construction in the town to accommodate the influx of people has been generic apartments and a series of fast food, car washes, and credit unions. WKU ranks bottom 25% in the nation. It basically a community college with a Panda Express. The school system is mediocre, run by teachers who phone it in. If you're not in AP classes, you're not going have many prospects for post-secondary education. Town basically shuts down around 8-9Pm on weekdays and 11-12 on weekends. There are some attempts to improve the situation, but the more open minded are running up against the close-minded boomer bible thumpers who have the majority.",

There are also a lot of cosy cafes and bakeries, which are nice to hang around in when the rain and wind show their faces — as they often do. The city has a good range of things to keep you interested, and the nature nearby is also pleasant. Definitely go to ARoS when you visit; the panoramic view is cool, but the exhibitions were also interesting when I went. The city is expensive, but Denmark is a pricey country in general. I would recommend staying in either Aarhus Ø or Frederiksbjerg if you could choose any neighbourhood, though those are also the most desirable ones so the competition for places is high haha. I personally don’t mind the weather so much, but that would be a negative for a lot of people. Ditto for cost of living. The only thing that would stop me moving here is that Aalborg and Copenhagen have better airport connections IMO.",

Locals mostly keep to themselves and don't mix much. Not enough nomadlisters. The co-working space here is alright (Harry Cow is €20 per day) but when it gets busy with 4-5 people having meetings and generally not being mindful of others, it's headache inducing. A lot of homeless weirdos with dogs asking for change who will insult you if you don't give them something (just ignore them). Bad behavior from cyclists and motorists towards pedestrians in the city centre. I've not felt unsafe in the city at night but I have to remain situationally aware when crossing paths with the usual weirdos you encounter. If you are already in a group or joining one here, you'll probably have fun. As a solo, I don't recommend staying here more than 2-3 weeks, you'll get bored.",

I have no idea why they’re saying it’s dangerous. There’s literally cops putting bike traps up to tempt people into stealing because there’s so little crime. It’s incredibly safe and welcoming to people of all races & genders. It’s also dry, incredibly dry with forest fires in the summer so the smoke can be intense for several months. It’s not rainy at all like the weather on here states. It appears the map & hospital are linked to another Ashland not in Oregon. The photo is however of Ashland, Oregon. Ashland is very white bread. There’s essentially no people of color or ethnicity. It’s comprised of people who took to spirituality instead of psychotherapy to work out their issues so there’s a fair amount of spiritual arrogance. There’s an infinite amount of spiritual workshops & endeavors. The town survives off of tourism & weed. It’s often joked that there’s 3 women to every man. I don’t know if that’s accurate though it feels like it. Almost all married couples who move here divorce. It’s an incredibly healing place for women, but not a place for relationship as most remain perpetually single here. It’s the single mom capital of the US. The hospitals, at least the Asante one that owns most, are incredibly low quality. Drive to OSHU in Portland should you need a hospital.",

Huge number of dental offices. Tons of big churches full of big hair, cowboy boots, and not a lot of anyone who seems truly to have faith, which I could respect.

      "description": "From 2015 to 2019 I have lived in Chania. There were not many expats, mainly older brithisn expats. Some artists, writers etc... Organic shops just starting ,spiritual community just starting.. Few scattered ppl across the west of Crete. It has apparently started to change now, more and more expats coming, I see more and larger FB nomad groups.. back then there was absolutely nothing of such kind. I had tried to create community through couchsurfing back then and met a few interesting people. However I can confirm what was written before. There sems to be a nomad group and coworking now in Chania. Check in Facebook, I saw it. Since 2019 the prices have risen and rent has not been affordable anymore. that's why I left in 2019. I was unable of find an apartment to rent all year. They tolerate you from Septebemr to May, then you have to leave.. where to? Even if you were ok to pay 700EUR plus amonth for an apartment, I couldn't find anyone interested in renting out year round. Mind you I do speak greek. The greeks just make airbnb for 3 months in summer, then go to the olive picking...dancing in winter then spring comes back. ITs a simple life for them and they don't think much ahead. And they obviously dont need the extra income from housing. They all still own houses and land, so they dont need to worry about basic needs. Easiest is probably if you just buy a house in a village. But that comes with structural problems. Police, hospitals, public services, workers, are not reliable. Also if you have greek friends, they are nice as long as you give money, but you will never be part of the family and you can never rely fully on them. Just be warned. Good to have a mix of friends. You ned the greeks to get the greek price and to get treated right otherwise you will be screwed over all the time. If you are ok to bitt eh bullet, it can be enjoyable. Weather and the sea is great, and food is amazing. If you are very very patient then it might be your thing. It really depends what you are looking for. Internet was terrrible back then. Dont know about now... in 2022. I could not even desing my website with the home internet in the AIRBNB apartment. People there live very much offline, at the max they have a facebook company.. so dont expect things to be organised well..",

      "description": "I really like ABQ. There is a crime problem and people complain about it all the time, but if you choose your neighborhood carefully and lock up your stuff that can mostly be avoided. Fun, sort of weird vibe with a unique culture, fascinating history, and great food. Perfect weather year round with just enough of each season without too much snow or too much heat. Bosque area or Sandia mountains are great for hiking, easy weekend getaways to New Mexico's national parks (White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns in particular are fun!) and other areas to explore (blue hole in Santa rosa, Santa Fe, Native american ruins, etc), as well as southern Colorado and Arizona. Its just a different kind of place than any other city. Good size and decent airport, but doesn't feel huge. Politically somewhat moderate- the north half of the state is liberal and the south and all the Texan transplants are conservative so it lands somewhere in the middle. Generally friendly locals and a nice melting pot of Native American, Mexican, and other cultures without a lot of judginess- very live and let live. And cheaper than almost any other \"big\" city in the USA. I have no idea how anyone chooses to live in Phoenix when the weather is so awful compared to ABQ, or chooses Denver when the cost of living is so high compared to ABQ. And Texas is too humid, so New Mexico is a nice little spot in the middle of all of it.",

The city is bike friendly and foreign friendly, much better than the east and the south part of Finland. The city is promoting startups and improving environment toward internationalisation, so the future is bright and worthy. There is not much nightlife activities to do besides drinking and dancing, but in the summer you can do sports as it is never dark. I love the pier and city library, and this is the most famous area in Oulu where you can find many interesting events like the Polar Bear Pitch, Farmer's Market, MegaMatching, etc. Besides being called the Silicon Valley of Finland, Oulu is also a heaven to outdoor lovers with many trail paths as well as their campfires and saunas along the rivers and lakes. To me Oulu is perfect for Nomads who are up to challenges.",

      "description": "Just spent almost two weeks here after a two week stay in SMA. This is a very pretty town, but 2 weeks is too long (3 days max if you just want to vacation). There are many many steps and hills, so walking is the best way to get around. I felt safe in the tourist areas, but with many narrow passageways, be careful if you are alone. There is a lot of dogs barking at all hours that echo due to this area being a valley. There is very little green space. Also, not sure if there was some recent protests, but we saw a lot of graffiti on historical sites and the staff works every day to scrub it off. I’m ok with protesting, but to vandalize historical builds is just sad. One positive, accommodations are cheaper than SMA and CDMX, however, food is more expensive than CDMX. Btw, the mummy museum, it’s more of a spectacle that is kinda sad and disrespectful, in my opinion. It could have been much better had it been educational. Finally, don’t be alarmed if you hear random cannon-like fires as they are just ritual procedures. It sounds like an invasion and it is mixed in with fireworks and firecrackers. They happen randomly at random times and days.",

One particularly disturbing incident involved two men who went from arguing to one punching the other, knocking him unconscious.

The pros: Art Noveau architecture and lots of green areas, generally very safe city regardless of neighborhood. I'd recommend stopping by for a few days (a week tops) if you're in Norway anyway, but I would not recommend moving here for an extended period of time.

Pretty much any apartment has at least a 100 Mbps connection and a big portion already have upwards of 300 Mbps both download and upload. Some even have a 1 Gbps connection. If you only judge by the speed you get at cafes, then obviously you won't get a fast internet since the available bandwidth is split between everyone who's connected at that time, but that's a very poor way of judging it. My 4G connection itself gets around 85 Mbps, which is way higher than what you get in most other countries from a broadband connection!",

      "description": "I've spent the past four months living in Quito, and to be honest, I've decided that I won't be returning to this country again. My experience here has been incredibly frustrating, especially when dealing with the average Ecuadorian citizens. For instance, when you go to a store and ask for a specific item, you often end up with something entirely different. Additionally, using Uber has its challenges, as many drivers keep their phones in their laps, constantly glancing down at the GPS instead of using a phone holder for safety. While I've always had a love for dogs and grew up with them, my time here in Quito has led me to develop a genuine fear and dislike for them. It's not just the stray dogs causing issues on the streets; it's also the ones owned by people in lower-income areas. Many of these dogs are not properly controlled and have a tendency to randomly attack passersby. I had a particularly distressing encounter with a group of aggressive dogs during my third month here. Moreover, if you happen to wear shoe sizes above 10 and a half, you'll face difficulties finding suitable footwear, as these sizes are rarely available anywhere in the city. As for the dating scene, I found it to be quite lackluster, especially as a male. Quito doesn't offer a wide range of activities or a thriving expat culture. Most locals you encounter seem to be interested in forming friendships only to gain something from you. On a more positive note, I did find some redeeming qualities in Quito, such as the ability to take quick trips to places like Banos and the overall cost of living. However, based on my experiences, I wouldn't recommend living in Quito for an extended period, as it doesn't offer much in terms of a fulfilling experience. You're not missing out on much by choosing to explore other places instead.",

      "description": "Don't let yourself be discouraged by the reviews here! Most of them are untrue and very negative and actually they made me skip Santiago in 2022. I came to spend a month in February 2024 and it was amazing! Everyday I got impressed by how nice this city feels. I've been in every latam country apart from Venezuela. Santiago is for sure one of the best. The city is very developed, clean and organized at the same time has a lot of shops, nice architecture, museums, bars and places with a soul. It's safer than most Latam countries and the quality of life is very high (also better than in all of the latam countries). It's not expensive, I'd actually place it as cheaper than most (it's for sure cheaper than Brazil, Medellin, groceries are cheaper than most of the latam countries, uber probably more expensive). The city has a very good metro line, bike itau rentals, allowing you to go everywhere and is very walkable and bikeable, lots of parks and nice streets. There are also many places that you can visit around the city, with 1 hour to the nice beaches and 1 hour to nice mountains. About the common thing in those reviews \"boring\" - every big city needs to be discovered, one needs to learn where to go out, which park is nice etc. Santiago is no different than that. Once you learn how to manouver it, it becomes very lively and exciting. Some examples of party areas are: Manuel Montt, Lastaria (bars), Bellas Artes. The digital nomad scene is not very big compared to e.g. Buenos Aires or Medellin, but does it mean that's a bad thing? Sometimes it's even better because it's easier to make friends in 10 person groups than 200 drunk people groups. There are many international communities thriving here just check the meetup app which offers language exchange meetups or internations community where people organize for multiple meetups during the week, such as sunset hiking etc.",

It's one of the few UK places outside of London which has a considerable cultural/creative scene. Unfortunately, the city has a massive problem with street-sleeping, begging and drugs (Many street people from the rest of the UK relocate to Brighton). It's difficult to spend an hour walking through the town centre without being harassed. In my 6 months living there, my apartment (in a 'posh' area) was broken into twice at night. The city is expensive. Affordable if you are on a London salary & commuting - otherwise it's not worth it. For nomads, I'd recommend looking further along the South coast for a better cost of living.",

You cannot easily find things you need so bring all your necessities to start with. I have barely seen a street light, the traffic can be unbelievable. It's the perfect place for a real cultural experience and to learn wolof and French. You almost have no choice but to when here. Food made by the family I stayed with is great. So far I've only ate out once at a place in the city and I was not impressed. Get all necessary vaccines before coming here and depending on where you are staying. From what I see this country is very much undeserved and they really deserve better than this, so don't expect to get vaccines readily available like living in other parts of the world.",

      "description": "Personal Rating: 2/5 As a nomad kiteboarder, I spent 2 weeks in Cartagena just to work and enjoy the sunsets on the water. On the positive side, the city provides affordable accommodation options and a decent food scene with noteworthy restaurants like Celele or bars like Alquimico. The city's nightlife boasts lively bars and rooftop venues, and the sunsets are truly beautiful. However, prostitution and sex tourism is really to much and to present, which may be uncomfortable for some visitors... Safety can be a concern depending on where you stay (locals advised me not to walk alone at night). The city is really noisy, and full of scams. A short trip there can have it's charms if you stay in the Centro or Boca Grande or Castillo Grande. If you look for protitutes, it's like open bar. Overwise I think this place is a bit overrate for the DNs lifestyle.",

      "description": "I spent a month here. I think it's a livable city but I don't know the value of living here long-term compared to other cities in LatAm. Pros: - Great bar and restaurant scene. Coffee shops are really chill. Service is really good for the most part, but everyone is too cool to be friendly (hipsters). - It doesn't feel too unsafe, especially if you're not out late at night. It's no worse than any US coastal city. Maybe even safer. (came from Chicago, definitely safer than Chicago) - There are some American/European expats and tourists here, but it's not like Mexico City levels. You will need to go out a lot to find them. This can be a pro or a con. I think you really need to like drinking to meet people here as there isn't much else to do. - It's definitely a walkable city, but the public transit isn't super useful for an expat/nomad. Ubers are ridiculously cheap anyway and I never had a bad driver. You can get anywhere you need to go for a few dollars. - Climate, at least in winter, is perfect. Not too hot or too cold. Some people don't like how it drops into the 50s at night, but I don't really notice cause I'm a Northerner anyway. Though there are some bad air quality days if you're sensitive to that. Cons: - If you stay in Colonia Americana or Providencia (and you'll most likely stay in either one of these hoods since they're safe and convenient), it's very yuppy. Yes, Mexico has yuppies. And that's not exactly what I signed up for visiting Mexico. So if you like Brooklyn and \"cool people\", this is the spot... me personally, I like a friendlier and less upper-class crowd. I don't find the people here particularly curious or eager to get to know foreigners even though there aren't that many tourists here compared to other major Mexican locations. It's not unfriendly either, I just think it's fairly townie. - The security culture is pretty intense here. Feels a little over-the-top compared to the relative safety. A lot of \"haves vs. have nots\" kind of vibe here... I don't really like that. I prefer a more egalitarian atmosphere. - Tons of grafitti in the central city. Definitely a lack of respect for private property here. - Tourist sites are pretty boring if you're here for a short stay. I don't even think it's worth it to visit as a tourist or for only a couple of days. It's a good place to practice Spanish for a month, experience living abroad for the first time, or save some dollars in a place with mostly familiar amenities. - The cost of living is overall low here but Mexico has gotten a lot more expensive than it used to be. I'm not sure it's a great deal anymore. Cheaper than the US, but maybe only 15% cheaper than the cheapest mid-tier Midwest city (like a Columbus). - The grocery situation isn't great, especially in Colonia Americana. It seems like people eat out all the time. - The best amenities are in the burbs but you probably don't want to live there. I did visit Zapopan and it feels a lot like a US burb. - Very liberal. Again, feels like Brooklyn. If you're not a lefty, this is probably not your city. - I think people drink and party and go to music shows here. If that's not your thing, it's probably going to be hard to meet people here.",

      "description": "I have visited Tallahassee several times over the past few years. I agree that it doesn't feel particularly safe - even in areas that appear \"safe\". I felt particularly unsafe at gas stations and, as a woman, would not stop for gas by myself in Tallahassee. I loved the Tallahassee Nature Museum, which I did feel safe visiting by myself. They also have ziplining there, which was a dream - up above the cypress swamp! I loved the fact that there were so many nature parks, bird sanctuaries and places to go canoeing and kayaking within an easy drive of this city. FSU has an outstanding law school, but the university is located in an area that is particularly unsafe. I also noticed a definite \"redneck\" presence in other areas of the city.",

Nightlife stops at 1am except nightclubs which are filled with smoke, music is mostly Serbian or a mix with Serbian, all places are pretty casual (no high end feel) and at night all the streets (even the furthest ones) are filled with party people.

Social culture is very uncanny valley, people are \"polite\" but it's extremely fake, which you'll notice in subtle ways like slow service, not saying \"you're welcome\" to \"thank you,\" and just a general dispassionate disposition even if you're very polite (which I am). I've also gone on a few dates here, and each one has been in a constant competition for the most awkward thing I've ever experienced (and I've gone out with people all over the world).

      "description": "I’ve been to 14 countries across 4 continents and travelled most of the US and I must say Havana is probably the most incredible city I have ever been to but is probably better suited for a vacation than for nomading. It’s not difficult to find wifi as most airbnbs and restaurants have it but it’s not reliable if you have important video conferencing calls or need to constantly stream something. Since most industries are publicly owned by the government, there’s a deep lack of commercialization that makes this place look so different from what you see in most other countries. Instead of large advertisements and billboards at every turn, there’s rich and beautiful art culture that makes just walking around and exploring this place the streets so enjoyable. Many people say that Havana feels like it’s stuck in the 1950’s which is definitely true since the classic city architecture and the vintage American muscle cars are all so well preserved. If you admire live music then you are definitely in for a treat as there is usually so many talented musicians and performers at every corner and in most bars/restaurants. The food is mostly seafood but it’s underwhelming as it lacks flavor. Cuban coffee & rum on the other hand definitely do not disappoint nor do the famous Cuban cigars if you’re into that. Another huge highlight is the Cuban people. They are truly the warmest and most welcoming of any country that I have been to. Such a diverse community and everyone always a bright smile on their face and are so excited to welcome you to their beautiful country. Knowing Spanish definitely helps but there is usually someone around that speaks English pretty well and can help you if you need. Yes there are definitely struggles with a lack of certain supplies and some infrastructure challenges but I honestly felt like it made for a more unique experience that I very much enjoyed. Overall i’d say pros/cons Pros: Beautiful city to explore Perfect weather Amazing people VERY safe (and not with cops at every corner) Quite affordable Cons: Unreliable Wifi Underwhelming food Limited resources Need cash for all transactions It’s probably not up to everyone but it offers a very unique culture and has such an amazing history to learn about. If you like good art, live music, and carribean weather, this is a great vacation spot.",

We visited the unexploded bomb museum, which was interesting but tiny. There's some French cafes and massage places. But everything is quite basic. I'd just go straight to Laung Prabang if you want to see more of Laos. Or Vang Vieng if you want to party. Vientiane wasn't very remote worker suitable either, just like entire Laos. Internet is slow and if it's not slow it's unstable and cuts out. Food ingredient quality seems very low but you pay the same price as in Thailand for worse. Laotian people are REALLY friendly though and their English is much much better than Thai people.",

You have to carry cash around and lots of bills as worth 1/40th of what they were a few years ago. You can't really use cards anywhere, except dollar ATMs and some supermarkets. Electricity mostly from generators, which have downtime a few hours a day. You need to check the daily hours of supply for the building before booking a place. 4G internet good 30+Mbps. Wired internet variable. Local SIM, I got a Touch Lebanon one with 20GB data for about $25/month. Pricier if you buy at the airport. Airport close to city centre. $10-15 taxi fare. Uber and Bolt work but you must assign payment as cash and it will be more than the app says, because of the high downward volatility of the LBP currency. Some classier cafes or restaurants will take USD notes but mostly you need LBP. Heaps of culture and history. Heaps of street art.

Much pollution also (think of Pittsburgh PA in the 60's) so the quality of life is poor. Very few hotels, so you'll have to rent a flat on AirBNB for only 20 USD/Euro per night.

This town would be great for you. In terms of speaking the language - you need to know Russian at certain degree, otherwise it might a bit a hard for you to navigate in the city. The main street of the city is Krasnaya street and you can take a bike and go through the whole street and enjoy the beauty and the peace of the city. In terms of natural beauty, go to parks like Solnechniy ostrov, Dendrarium, Zaton, etc. Most likely you'll enjoy the most in the center of the city. If you need to go shopping look no further and go to \"Gallery Krasnodar\" - a huge shopping mall where you can eat, go to movies (in Russian of course, no subtitles) or shop for groceries. Uber is widely used there, although it's operating under the brand Yandex.Taxi nowadays, so you might rather use that service in Russia. Overall, a good city to live in and not expensive. If you want to eat cheap go to a small family-restaurants. Air is quite polluted, unfortunately. Driving also not recommended. Streets are narrow and driving is chaotic. If you want something nearby the sea consider Sochi - it's a bit more expensive, but more developed for foreigners, I think.",

The old town is really beautiful, the nightlife is also great. Can't remember the last time I had such a good nightlife experience, the bars and clubs are at a high level. Overall everyday people are friendly and nice to talk, however, about 50 percent don't speak English. I was lucky that I know some Russian, in some places which are highly rated even staff couldn't understand a word in English. The place is worth a visit, but have a precaution at all times, as scams are happening, especially at restaurants and bars for the foreigners. While I visited the strategy was to go to the places which only have really high ratings in trip advisor, so by doing that I avoided places that might scam, and the experience overall was good. If the place from the foreigns is not rated highly enough, just better be safe and plan in advance where to go. I tried working there also, so managed to get some cozy cafes in town with decent internet.",

If you don’t know, it’s a big problem. Have an advice from the local, it’s important ⚠️ You should have a key for great experience in Kharkiv, get it! 🔑 WHY KHARKIV? Cool, well-educated people with own opinion, business-minded, direct. You’ll not find old historical buildings here the city was rebuilt ground up after WW2. The city is managed better than any other Ukrainian city, it’s clean. Not soviet in it’s heart ❤️ WHERE TO BE? Draw a triangle between Gor Kafe 1654 (tip), Otakara Yarosha st. (bottom). Rent there, live there, walk there, party there 😎 WHERE I LIKE TO WALK 1) Gorky Park, 2) Sarzhyn Yar (subway station Botanical Garden), 3) Pushkinskaya str. + around NTU “KHPI”, 4) Sumskaya + Rymarskaya. TAXI ONLY right now ON Taxi app with business class cars is the best and rather cheap, Uber and Bolt are so-so. HOTEL ONLY I’d not rent an apartment as prices aren’t fair (you can get a lot of money if you rent your apartment 10-15% a year 😉) rather look for a modern hotel like: 4 rooms and villa 4 rooms, Cosmopolit, Mirax, etc. normal Eastern European prices, rooms are spacious. DON’T WORRY it’s a safe place to be. I was never robbed or attacked even in scary 90-s, walking alone around dark, grotesque post-soviet haunted houses or empty streets, np at all. Locals love tourists and will help when they can, if you lost and people around don’t know English, you’ll soon find someone who’ll guide you, give you money and a good advice. People here are proud of the place and want others to know it. Good luck, see you here!",

People are extremely friendly, just gotta adapt to the culture a bit. Most seemed to be very interested in the fact that I was American. Felt kind of like the country is just starting to open up and it will be of more international interest in the upcoming 5 - 10 years. English is spoken in Minsk but probably less then in ukraine (my only other former soviet point of comparison). For entertainment, there's not much going on during the week but Zbitskaya street friday and saturday has bars overflowing into the streets during the summer time. It was a bit more expensive then I was expecting but I didn't really try to hustle for the best apartment rates. There's a bit of bureaucracy when it comes to renting an apartment, as a foreigner on a visa I had to notify the government of my whereabouts. I changed apartments and this resulted in me, my friend (who speaks russian) and the new landlord having to spend half a day at a government office updating them. I believe hotels can manage all this in the background for you so if I were to go back I would just get a hotel for the whole stay.",

If you clicked here because you're a seasoned traveler coming in with eyes wide open that Ethiopia is (very) poor but the experience and empathy to make it work in order to have an amazing travel experience: you can make it work. Ethiopia is the most foreign experience I have ever felt coming from a Western perspective. Nonetheless there are still loads of cafes, food is amazing (though you will get sick at least once), I was getting 25mbps on my phone, weather is good, everyday life is cheap. Modern apartment blocks are going up like crazy, but from a low base so housing can still be relatively expensive for what you get. It's enough to give you a home base to explore other areas of the country (which are insane travel experiences), and there is a young professional/expat scene to engage with when the rest of the city is overbearing. Granted, I spent only a week in Addis but have made good friends with a small group of locals/expats who had good insights, and have spent several years in Africa. The security issues in the rest of the country affect the vibe a lot, so it's tough to plan going there, but if that gets resolved I would recommend it for (very) adventurous travelers because the payoff in terms of experience is there.",

      "description": "In summer season, temperature will 31°C, feels like 36 or more, humidity is 90% even at 28°C. Nearly impossible to to work without a good AC. In rainy season, temperature drops under 30 and air quality becomes just terrible, leaving a window open will leave your floor black. Lots of places to rent, but very hard to close a long term rent deal due to landlords unwilling to close a deal remotely (cash only). Long term rentals are much more affordable than airbnb.",

      "description": "Love this city, very romantic and cool in the summer. but it is difficult to find a nice airbnb. it is too much small or too expensive for the quality. you will def have great time here. but unfortunately, I had problem to make friends here. some how, It seemed the locals were not quite interested in having communication or making forein friends even in the co-working space. I don't think this is because of the language barrier but...I cant explain this well. anyway, the city is great to stay from Jun - July(Aug starts getting rains.), would be much nicer if you can speak Russian. Goodluck!",

Iraqis love to small talk and make general jests or jokes to lighten the mood without revealing any personal information. however, some do complain a lot and emit negative energy, please understand that they're having a hard time. don't get anxious, enjoy the weather and the easy talk, and take pics :D",

I think safety is not that bad, just don't go outside very late, there isn't night life there at all and watch out when you use your mobile in street. Before going there, get a vpn subscription from ExpressVpn (it works great), without vpn internet is nearly useless. It's a great place for a short visit, but not recommended for a long time stay. No internatianal banking system works there! North areas are more expensive and better.",

Every day there are at least 2 festivals, 3 major concerts and tons of shows in theaters. The best season is winter and summer. The amount of decorations in the winter is incomparable (to London for example)! Snow adds magic to the city and if you are worried about the cold, there are plenty of shops with high quality winter clothes at decent prices. The city is very big, it will take ages to get somewhere and back, so only about 2 activities a day unless you live close.",
